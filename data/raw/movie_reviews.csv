Jonathan Romney,If this is a feel-good movie -- and by the end it certainly is -- then at least it challenges us to dig deep for those good feelings when everything inside those mausoleum walls is unrelievedly harsh and grey.,The Shawshank Redemption
Jay Boyar,"The Shawshank Redemption is both resigned and inspirational, grittily realistic and vaguely surreal, matter-of-fact and operatic. Somehow, these opposites are combined into a remarkably smooth and lyrical composition.",The Shawshank Redemption
Adam Mars-Jones,"The sad thing is that The Shawshank Redemption, a so-so film, would have made a terrific little movie. A pacier project would have given us less time to notice sentimentalities.",The Shawshank Redemption
Malcolm Johnson,"Next to Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption ranks as the strongest, purest film ever made from a novel or novella by Stephen King, a monster film where the horrors are frighteningly human.",The Shawshank Redemption
Yardena Arar,"It's Robbins and Freeman who carry the film, working around the most predictable moments with simple understatement.",The Shawshank Redemption
David Denby,"There's nothing going on in The Shawshank Redemption from shot to shot -- no expressive life, no spontaneity or feeling. It's a stunted movie.",The Shawshank Redemption
William Arnold,"The acting is so strong, so seductive in The Shawshank Redemption that you almost don't notice this epic prison drama isn't all that good.",The Shawshank Redemption
Manohla Dargis,"Darabont, making his debut as a director, is swamped by ambition. There is just too much here -- too much plot, too many particulars, too many prisoners vying for attention.",The Shawshank Redemption
Michael Medved,A hackneyed prison movie with acting so strong that it often seems more substantive than it is.,The Shawshank Redemption
Michael Wilmington,"The Shawshank Redemption may be working with stuff we've seen before, but it's surprisingly strong and engrossing. Even elitists in the audience who dismiss King as a shock schlockmeister may be amazed at this picture's narrative grip.",The Shawshank Redemption
Kenneth Turan,"Its message of hope and friendship comes premixed with a sizable dollop of unappetizing violence, intended to convince audiences that what they're watching isn't a big glob of cotton candy after all.",The Shawshank Redemption
Lea Saslav,"Darabont gets Robbins' most subtle and multi-layered performance to date. But the Oscar nomination will go to Freeman, who shows the majesty of sadness and how sweet redemption can be -- even when all hope is lost.",The Shawshank Redemption
Jeff Simon,"It's a movie with dignity and surprises and before it has finished, it has acquired a good deal of power.",The Shawshank Redemption
Lizzie Francke,"The towering Tim Robbins has a solidity and gentle interiority that occasionally reminds one here of Burt Lancaster. Of equal excellence is Morgan Freeman as Red, who holds the film together with his poetic, often quipping narration.",The Shawshank Redemption
Jack Mathews,"You've never seen a prison movie quite like it, and I found its eccentric rhythms and the performances of co-stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman nearly irresistible.",The Shawshank Redemption
Gary Thompson,Even the most prosecutorial viewer will concede that Robbins and Freeman give The Shawshank Redemption a persuasive validity. They hold The Shawshank Redemption together as it gives way to story-driven melodrama.,The Shawshank Redemption
Desmond Ryan,"A work of sincerity and honorable purpose, with a first-class cast... [But] Darabont has not found a way to resolve the problems and improbabilities that tower higher than the walls of the maximum security prison.",The Shawshank Redemption
Jay Carr,Never will you be so glad of the voyeuristic nature of filmgoing. Because The Shawshank Redemption is as close to prison as you'll want to get. And Robbins and Freeman make what could have been an endurance test an utterly engrossing experience.,The Shawshank Redemption
Frank Bruni,"It's a blissfully old-fashioned melodrama spanning three decades, a classic tall tale that experiences some particularly incredible growth spurts toward the end but manages to endure them without alienating the viewer.",The Shawshank Redemption
Rene Rodriguez,"It's way too long, blatantly manipulative, and sentimental to a fault. Still, the lead performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are heartfelt, impressively shaded pieces of work (Freeman in particular is a marvel).",The Shawshank Redemption
Wendy Ide,This magnificent multigenerational mafia drama represents a benchmark not just in crime movies but in American cinema as a whole.,The Godfather
Mark Johnson,"The Godfather works like a masterfully conducted orchestra, whose immaculate symphony is a meticulously crafted and extraordinarily integral thread in the fabric of cinema history.",The Godfather
Erick Estrada,... Villains and criminals that fulfill the American dream with complete disregard for the American way. A contradiction that engenders gods. [Full review in Spanish],The Godfather
Steven D. Greydanus,"Now half a century old, Francis Ford Coppola's revered New Hollywood masterpiece has one of the best-known final shots in film history - but it almost had a much more Catholic ending.",The Godfather
Matt Brunson,A cultural milestone.,The Godfather
Stephen Silver,"The Godfather is as much about America, and the American experience, as any other great movie is (50th anniversary)",The Godfather
Jason Bailey,Skepticism of American exceptionalism is far more commonplace now than it was when The Godfather was first released. But the fragility of the American Dream was revealing itself as the illusion it had always truly been.,The Godfather
Jake Cole,"The Godfather films have set home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramounts astonishing 4K restorations.",The Godfather
Michael Calleri,"50 years after its release on March 24, 1972, The Godfather is now and forever, one of the greats.",The Godfather
Victoria Luxford,"An engrossing metaphor for American capitalism, watching the film on the big screen emphasises the majesty of Coppolas work.",The Godfather
Tom Hutchinson,"It is a gangster film without any of the pity and hatred we might feel towards such aliens in our midst, because it recognises that in all of us there is the ignition towards power and criminality.",The Godfather
Brian Viner,The Godfather justifies every minute of its extravagant running time.,The Godfather
Dennis Harvey,"For all its graphic violence, the movie was—unlike the novel it was based on—no mere exercise in popcorn sensationalism; it was emotionally complex, tragic, melancholy, definitely for grownups.",The Godfather
Danny Leigh,"As the doomy burnish of Gordon Willis’s photography captures the darkened souls of the Corleones, the effect is flat-out mesmeric.",The Godfather
Richard Roeper,"The Godfather is the most memorable, most influential, most quoted, most beloved, most discussed, most imitated, most revered and most entertaining American movie ever made.",The Godfather
Brian Eggert,"Five decades later, The Godfather still resonates with the paradigm shifts from one generation to the next, still influences one filmmaker after another, and continues to be the foundation of a lasting mythology.",The Godfather
David Gonzalez,The Godfather is a rarity in film as every element off and on screen work here.,The Godfather
Adam Kempenaar,There is simply not a character introduced or exchange of words or looks that doesn't inform or add.,The Godfather
James Wegg,"Marlon Brando gives a bravura, dusty-voice performance in the title role as the Sicilian who harvests favours from all comers, only to ask them to be paid back.",The Godfather
Robin Holabird,"The Godfather redefined concepts of Mob movies by standing out artistically, and that comes partly from its distinct look, as deep browns and blacks contrast with light and golden tints reminiscent of Caravaggio...violence and beauty indelibly combine.",The Godfather
Juan Pablo Russo,"With a memorable performance from Heath Ledger, masterful direction from Nolan, and bold storytelling, this film stands out as one of the best comic book adaptations in film history. [Full Review in Spanish]",The Dark Knight
Akhil Arora,It doesn’t matter how many superhero movies its crosstown rival makes; it’ll never match the brilliance that Nolan delivered the same year Marvel began its infinite project. Firing on all cylinders … this is the most complete film Nolan has ever made.,The Dark Knight
Christian Eulinberg,"For the longest time, I’ve viewed this film as the Godfather of live-action Batman films.",The Dark Knight
Cory Woodroof,"The pinnacle of Nolan’s career so far, The Dark Knight is one of the most impressionable films of the 21st century (and one of the best).",The Dark Knight
Brian Eggert,"An incomparable crime thriller and superhero film, and an instant classic in both genres",The Dark Knight
Fico Cangiano,A masterpiece within or outside the superhero & comic book genre it explores. Heath Ledger delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history. [Full review in Spanish],The Dark Knight
Richard Crouse,A rare beast. It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.,The Dark Knight
Mike Massie,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.,The Dark Knight
Jason Best,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling.",The Dark Knight
Richard Propes,The awards hype is warranted.,The Dark Knight
Siddhant Adlakha,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era.",The Dark Knight
Josh Wilding,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time.",The Dark Knight
Felicia Feaster,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.,The Dark Knight
Paul McGuire Grimes,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him.",The Dark Knight
Micheal Compton,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year.",The Dark Knight
Danielle Solzman,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.,The Dark Knight
Mattie Lucas,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date,The Dark Knight
Rachel Wagner,Heath Ledger is great.,The Dark Knight
Eileen Jones,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up.",The Dark Knight
Zaki Hasan,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop.",The Dark Knight
Wendy Ide,The storytelling is leisurely and masterful; Coppola at the very peak of his powers.,The Godfather Part II
Montezuma,"If you like your drama on a low-key level with excellent acting all around, then Godfather II is where it's at. I wasn't a great fan of the original but this sequel succeeds in unraveling the saga of a simple Mafia family.",The Godfather Part II
Mark Johnson,"Through a compelling dual character study, the sequel explores the intertwined yet distinct paths of its protagonists. The result is a breathtaking display of filmmaking leaving us in awe of its expansive scope, attention to detail, and sheer perfection.",The Godfather Part II
Fico Cangiano,The finest example of when a sequel is superior to its predecessor. The Godfather Part II is one of the best films of all-time. A masterpiece. It's that simple. Full review in Spanish,The Godfather Part II
Matt Brunson,Lauded in some corners (although not this one) as being superior to its predecessor.,The Godfather Part II
Jake Cole,"The Godfather films have set home-video standards for decades, and that trend continues with Paramounts astonishing 4K restorations.",The Godfather Part II
Pauline Kael,It’s an epic vision of the corruption of America.,The Godfather Part II
Romola Costantino,"One leaves the theatre stunned by the cold, ruthless violence of which men who are so otherwise civilised (they, have nice homes, wear nice clothes, love their families and friends dearly) are capable.",The Godfather Part II
Alexander Walker,Director Francis Ford Coppola furnished a fully-fashioned gangster melodrama in the first film: in this one he stretches his talent to encompass a genuine American tragedy.,The Godfather Part II
Kirk Honeycutt,Seldom has a motion picture captured the feel and texture of novel form as this film does.,The Godfather Part II
Michael Billington,What particularly impresses me about the film is the way it conveys the feeling of being a young immigrant in the land of opportunity.,The Godfather Part II
Tom Hutchinson,"What is so good about the film is the sympathetic way that Coppola has treated such unsympathetic characters, machismo-minded males still worshiping at the god of tribal virility.",The Godfather Part II
Madeleine Harmsworth,"The Godfather, Part II grows more impressive by the minute.",The Godfather Part II
Soham Gadre,"This ideal is achieved perfectly in The Godfather: Part II, which to me is the best of the series.",The Godfather Part II
Susan Barton,"The cinematography is the third major element in Godfather, Part II, ranking with Coppola's direction and its major acting successes to create its convincing epic quality.",The Godfather Part II
Kevin Kelly,"All the performances are fine, especially Lee Strasberg as a despicable Meyer Lansky hood; Diane Keaton, as Michael's despairing wife; Robert Duvall, as his lawyer; and Robert De Niro, as Vito Adolini, nee Don Corleone.",The Godfather Part II
Dorothy Smiljanich,Acknowledgement should be given the film for its sweep and scope and a style so distinctive that Coppola must be credited with creating something entirely fresh and inimitable -- the hallmarks of a first-rate artist.,The Godfather Part II
Susan Stark,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II is an even richer, more spellbinding work than its wholly successful predecessor.",The Godfather Part II
Gene Siskel,"The new sequel to The Godfather, titled The Godfather, Part II, permits us a second look inside that room, inside that world. At times the vision is as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original.",The Godfather Part II
Desmond Ryan,"The Godfather, Part II really has no reason for its lavish existence other than the greediness of its makers. And that is the kind of avarice that a godfather appreciates.",The Godfather Part II
Grant Watson,"It brought the Holocaust to a mass non-Jewish audience at a time when survivors were dying of old age, and testimony was at risk of being lost.",Schindler's List
Wendy Ide,"Spielberg employs all the emotive Hollywood tools at his disposal and the result is a remarkable film with wide appeal and real importance. Neeson is phenomenal, but matched by towering performances from Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.",Schindler's List
Stephen Silver,"A great film, a powerful film, and even if it’s not the definitive American Holocaust film, it remains on the very short list of the most important ones. (30th anniversary)",Schindler's List
Anushka Halve,"This isn't your high-octane thriller; rather, acts of heroism unfold with a deliberate, strategic cadence.",Schindler's List
Mark Johnson,Spielberg’s most personal film is also his finest and most altruistic.,Schindler's List
Nanciann Cherry,"It's the faces that make Schindler's List a magnificent, harrowing, stomach-wrenching, emotional piece of cinema.",Schindler's List
Dan DiNicola,Schindler's List is not only a masterpiece but something of a miracle.,Schindler's List
Keith Garlington,A film of immense power and the deepest sincerity.,Schindler's List
James Wegg,It’s a bad business,Schindler's List
Quentin Falk,"Steven Spielberg's triumphant Schindler's List is a remarkable and moving memorial to an historical Holocaust. It is also a timely reminder of what genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" really mean. But, above all, it is a cracking movie.",Schindler's List
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"Using every ounce of his awe some technical skill, the man who sent T. rex and Indiana Jones racing through our imagination brings us a story of human horror beyond imagination.",Schindler's List
Susan Stark,"Once in a very great while, a movie insinuates itself so deeply into your consciousness that it offers not vicarious experience but instead, direct experience. Steven Spielberg's heartfelt, monumental Schindler's List is such a movie.",Schindler's List
Henry Sheehan,"This is a movie that succeeds brilliantly not just in bringing a terrible chapter in history back to life, but in meticulously depicting the processes through which a self-obsessed and immature man becomes integrated and responsible.",Schindler's List
Michael H. Price,"There are enough ""Spielbergian"" set pieces and incidental touches to keep Schindler accessible to those who believe that the best Spielberg is the perky Spielberg of the E.T. and Indiana Jones romps.",Schindler's List
Ron Weiskind,"How does one comprehend the magnitude of the Holocaust? Remarkably, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List defines the horror of Hitler's ""final solution"" on vividly human terms without diminishing its scope or impact.",Schindler's List
Lawrence Toppman,"Few films have ever dealt so chillingly with what philosopher Hannah Arendt called ""the banality of evil.""",Schindler's List
Joe Pollack,"Liam Neeson is a splendid Schindler, tall, handsome, devil-may-care and a poker-playing genius. Ben Kingsley, as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's accountant and chief aide, is as brilliant as ever, and Ralph Fiennes is evil and powerful as Amon Goeth.",Schindler's List
Steve Persall,A towering cinematic accomplishment from director Steven Spielberg that left all other 1993 films in its wake.,Schindler's List
Michael MacCambridge,Spielberg's dazzlingly modulated epic Schindler's List is nothing less than astonishing.,Schindler's List
Philip Strick,"A near-documentary, brilliantly designed and choreographed, [and] a character study in which Ralph Fiennes, the winningly urbane Liam Neeson, and the magnificently impassive Ben Kingsley attain a memorable dramatic intensity.",Schindler's List
Cody Dericks,"For all its titanic technical breakthroughs and iconic moments of spectacle, its thematic resonance and sweeping storytelling have helped maintain its legacy beyond similar blockbusters.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Allyson Johnson,The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King asks us to reckon with death and then heals that emotional wound by reminding us that death isn’t a tragedy but the final passage of life.,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Collin Garbarino,"Depictions of true friendship in movies are rare. Depictions of male friendship, even rarer. With The Lord of the Rings, audiences saw trust and affection develop between men brought together by a common purpose.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"It is a film of epic proportions, huge in scale and filled with moments of violence and emotion. But it is also an intimate and emotional experience, in which many viewers will end up shedding several tears. Full review in Spanish.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Jae-Ha Kim,"The extendedversion of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" doesn't feel any longer than the film everybody saw at the multiplex. There's 50 extra minutes of never-before-seen footage added into the original theatrical release.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Mark Johnson,Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings is one of the most astonishing achievements in the history of film. It is nothing short of magical.,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Fico Cangiano,"A glorious and satisfactory close to one of the best film trilogies of all time. Peter Jackson's third entry is his biggest in scope, and also his most emotional. For Frodo! [Full review in Spanish]",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Sean Axmaker,"... a blood and thunder finale that takes the viewer into a conflict of (quite literally) Middle-Earth shattering dimensions. If anything, Peter Jackson and his collaborators try to do too much with the final book of J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Film Companion Staff,...one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told...,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Mike Massie,"The massive scope of this climactic chapter is once again awe-inspiring, entailing exceptional use of computer graphics, prosthetics and makeup, costuming, and sets.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Rachel Wagner,For 2004 [the special effects] look great.,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Kaleem Aftab,"Peter Jackson's place in cinematic history is cemented with The Return of the King and now Star Wars seems like a film made a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Sr. Rose Pacatte,The Return of the King is really the heart of this cinematic masterpiece.,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Alex Casey,"At a whopping, hilarious, 4.20 duration for the extended version, Return of the King is the Oscar-winning, magnum opus of the franchise.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Jonathan Romney,"This atavistic Christians-vs-Moors narrative doesn't belong in the present day, and that's no doubt why so many people are addicted to it: it's so ideologically overstated that it can easily be brushed off as harmlessly quaint escapism.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
James Christopher,"The sense of closure is exquisite, but I'm not sure I'm able to forgive Peter Jackson for the three years that he has taken to put it on the screen. The wait has been excruciating.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Giovanni Fazio,"[It[ almost needs no review. If you liked, or disliked, either of the first two films, this one offers more of the same, with the emphasis on the ""more.""",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Antonia Quirke,"Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is the good king of the title, and while the actor may look fetching in a crown and cloak, he doesn't have half of the gravitas of Sean Bean's Boromir in the first film.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Sean Nelson,"Ultimately, the chief difference between this film and its two predecessors is the presence of resolution. The story ends, just like we all knew it would. And there's something inherently disappointing about that.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Tim Evans,This is the crowning glory -- a cinematic feat that satisfies at every level.,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
Sean Axmaker,... a film that twists and turns and double backs on itself with the sheer delight of a narrative magician.,Pulp Fiction
Roger Ebert,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking.",Pulp Fiction
Marjorie Baumgarten,Rarely have I left a movie theatre more thrilled or invigorated as I did after leaving Pulp Fiction.,Pulp Fiction
Tom Long,"There is a fine madness to writer/director/actor Quentin Tarantino's latest wonderwork, Pulp Fiction, which is certainly one of the most exciting films of the past 20 years and easily the most important film of 1994.",Pulp Fiction
Peter Keough,"Unlike his first film, Reservoir Dogs, whose genius lay in its ability to shock and dazzle, Pulp Fiction penetrates the glib surface of style, allusion, and machismo to the murky meaning of these things.",Pulp Fiction
Peter Travers,There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive.,Pulp Fiction
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"The actors know they've got a good thing and, echoing Tarantino's boldness and resourcefulness, they give it everything they've got.",Pulp Fiction
Elizabeth Pincus,"Like its source material, Pulp Fiction is comic and grim, sun-soaked and shadowy, tender and blunt. A pop-drenched dream reel, the film is both a reverential nod to the power of words and a stunning entertainment that more than lives up to its hype.",Pulp Fiction
Desson Thomson,"Brilliant and brutal, funny and exhilarating, jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet.",Pulp Fiction
Marylynn Uricchio,"A truly great soundtrack keeps the tone hip and even steals a scene or two. Not that Tarantino doesn't have plenty to spare. Pulp Fiction is riveting filmmaking funny, visceral, stylish and so unabashedly original that you never want it to end.",Pulp Fiction
Dolores Barclay,"Unlike too many movies with annoying soundtracks that make up for inferior filmmaking, Tarantino allows natural sounds to slip in -- traffic utensils and other everyday background noises. It allows for more drama and a greater buildup of tension.",Pulp Fiction
Gene Siskel,"In between the violence, which does get hard R-rated extreme, the real pleasure of Pulp Fiction is listening to these folks talk. If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.",Pulp Fiction
Steve Persall,Nothing you've ever seen on screen fully prepares you for the audacious ferocity of Quentin Tarantino's pitch-black comedy Pulp Fiction.,Pulp Fiction
Rene Rodriguez,"[Pulp Fiction] is a dazzling feat of writing. Lurid and unexpectedly hilarious, it's a deceptive piece of work that appears slight and simple on the surface but grows richer and more complex with hindsight.",Pulp Fiction
Robbie Roberts,"Quentin Tarantino, two movies into his directing career, brings to mind the early years of Godard and Truffaut, Coppola when he arrived with the Godfathers and Scorcese when he took to the streets of New York.",Pulp Fiction
David Baron,A 2 1/2 -hour tour-de-force of personal style that (with the help of an extraordinary cast) creates more memorable characters than any other movie this year.,Pulp Fiction
Dennis King,Possessed of the literary grit and low-life existentialism that its title suggests Pulp Fiction is a hard-boiled work of virtuoso moviemaking by writer-director Quentin Tarantino.,Pulp Fiction
Harper Barnes,"If you like crime fiction and enjoy superb acting, characters deep enough to bleed (sometimes excessively), suspenseful plots, masterly direction and brilliant colloquial dialogue, Pulp Fiction is definitely for you.",Pulp Fiction
Sean P. Means,"What writer-director Quentin Tarantino serves up in Pulp Fiction is an all-out thrill ride -- like careening through a Raymond Chandler anthology, with Robert Altman and Dennis Miller in the back seat in a '64 Mustang doing Warp 9.",Pulp Fiction
Nanciann Cherry,"Pulp Fiction runs more that 2 1/2 hours, but it's still lean and mean. Every element of the bizarre, dizzying journey is carefully conceived and executed to take its viewers into the darkest recesses of life, then, with a wink and a laugh, set them free.",Pulp Fiction
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"An extraordinary adventure that combines incredible real locations with great-looking models, visual effects, excellent performances and memorable characterizations, managing to immerse the viewer in Middle Earth. Full review in Spanish.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
James Croot,"There's still an organic, made-in-Jackson's-backyard feel to some of the battle and character scenes.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Sarah Brinks,I'm sure you can smell the nerdy fan-girl coming from this review but it is a film I genuinely love and was thrilled to rewatch for this challenge.,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Murtada Elfadl,Excellent well-made adventure film especially when compared with mediocre output of current superhero movies. Grand old fashioned entertainment.,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Film Companion Staff,Peter Jackson throws you onto the battlefield with your favourite characters.,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Mike Massie,"Well balanced and stimulating, the film alternates between intense action, light comedy, and sincere drama (a few moments are even reserved for romance).",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Fico Cangiano,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation is an impressive beast of a film that will steal your heart every time. It grabs you with its sense of urgency, huge scope and hope. The beginning to one of the best movie trilogies of all time. [Full review in Spanish]",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Joshua Rothkopf,Jackson is working from obvious passion; he knows the most special of effects are expected of him but deploys his technology smartly.,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Rachel Wagner,Ian McKellen... does a wonderful job and he really sort of grounds the film.,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Alex Casey,"God, it's good.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Louis Menand,"The Fellowship of the Ring is an impressive piece of filmmaking. It is, indeed, intensely faithful to the text, although, unsurprisingly, a great deal of the story is omitted.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Covadonga G. Lahera,[Peter] Jackson's ability to maintain the universality of a story is praiseworthy. [Full Review in Spanish],The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Sean Axmaker,"New Zealand genre film maverick Peter Jackson does the impossible: he makes a faithful, magical, thrilling, and-most importantly-compelling film version of J.R.R. Tolkein's great cult fantasy epic.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Christopher Tookey,"I have no serious criticisms. The film does full justice to Tolkien, who has often -- and erroneously -- been accused of escapism.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Dennis King,"It's hard to imagine any but the most nit-picky and dogmatic being disappointed by this epic, lovingly crafted movie.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Xan Brooks,"Most ambitiously, this rousing adventure closes with an ending that's closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Unknown reviewer,"This isn't some happy, kid-friendly adventure -- it's the story of how an entire world is plunged into war.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Andrew Collins,"Only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Scott Tobias,"An enthusiastic visionary set loose on one of the biggest playgrounds ever constructed, Jackson brings more personality to the series' first installment, The Fellowship Of The Ring, than typically seeps into a franchise of this magnitude.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Michael Sragow,"The Fellowship of the Ring is a movie masterpiece thrilling, passionate and wise.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Zita Short,It makes a case for Sergio Leone as a true artist and it slowly reveals itself to have real emotional heft when you begin considering some of the ambitious themes that Leone tackles.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Matt Brunson,"While it may not be the best Western ever made - heck, it's not even the best Western Leone ever made - it's clearly the work of a master filmmaker whose style has never grown stale.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Sarah Boslaugh,"If you only see one spaghetti Western in your lifetime, this is the one to see.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Sarah Brinks,"The score for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is magnificent. The main theme that plays over the titles is simultaneously of a specific time and also timeless.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
A.S. Hamrah,"Leone's penchant for contrasting two kinds of shots, close-ups and long shots, finds its corollary in the gray or blue...Leone turns gray soldiers blue in the simplest way possible. Movies were invented for ideas like that.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Mike Massie,Boasts what is often considered the greatest showdown ever filmed.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Allen Almachar,The quintessential spaghetti western.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Kyle Smith,"As in an opera, the characters are archetypes, not figures we particularly identify with; as in an opera, we waited a long time for the inevitable ghastly conclusion; as in an opera, Leone seeks (and delivers) a kind of ecstatic dread.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Tom Meek,"The final scene in the Sad Hill Cemetery is a riveting spectacle, made so by some brilliantly tight editing and underscored by the genius of Ennio Morricone's genre-defining composition.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Asher Luberto,"When Ennio Morricone's score kicks in and Leone's editing picks up, our everyday problems fade away like a cowboy riding off into the sunset.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Laura Bradley,"If you've never gotten into spaghetti Westerns, there's no time like the present to give it a go with one of the best.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Bob Strauss,"But ""GBU"" remains the iconic piece for all time.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Sean Axmaker,"There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who love Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and those who resist the machismo and gallows humor of what is arguably the definitive spaghetti western.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Cole Smithey,"Leone's liberal use of widescreen shots in conjunction with extreme close-ups gives the movie an epic quality that is matched in scope by a skeletal narrative structure that breathes with a poker-faced mood, tone, and personality.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
Tim Brayton,A unique vision of the American West as place of desolation and ruin on a truly epic scale.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"

Cameron Meier,Forrest was an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.,Forrest Gump
David Denby,"Zemeckis has made a fast movie about a slow hero; he transforms Forrest's daffy misconceptions into lyrical flights. Forrest Gump has a softer, more delicate touch and a richer current of feeling than any of the other holy-innocent movies.",Forrest Gump
Michael MacCambridge,"What makes Forrest Gump a stunning triumph, a departure from the mediocre norm? A big reason is the way the film provides a fresh perspective on the familiar experience, through the eyes of its unforgettable protagonist.",Forrest Gump
Steve Persall,"Forrest Gump isn't a movie for cynics. Instead, it's one of those rare films that seduces viewers into overlooking its faults with the sheer goodness of its heart.",Forrest Gump
Michael Medved,"Hanks' performance [is] a triumph of dignity, decency, and warm-hearted humor... Even more than his Oscar-winning achievement in Philadelphia, this is a role that will be remembered as long as people care about great acting.",Forrest Gump

Kristal Brent Zook,"Forrest Gump is for big kids what playing Nintendo is for little ones -- that is, the neato thing about Robert Zemeckis' film is the clever techno-wizardry produced by Ken Ralston and Industrial Light and Magic.",Forrest Gump
Harper Barnes,"Hanks never strikes a false note, never panders to his mentally slow character nor tries to make him more than he is, despite a script that occasionally calls on him to utter what presumably are intended to be simple profundities.",Forrest Gump

Bill DuPre,Forrest Gump is a rare treat: a movie that delivers a message of hope and faith without delving into preachiness. Much of that success is due to Hanks' majestically deadpan performance.,Forrest Gump

Bob Thomas,"Perhaps it is postmodern filmmaking, whatever that means. In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers.",Fight Club
PJ Nabarro,The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value.,Fight Club
Patrick Z. McGavin,"The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity.",Fight Club

Joshua Starnes,"If A New Hope is the body of Star Wars, Empire can lay pretty good claim to being its soul.",Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back

Christopher Brandon,"A cyberpunk thriller that's so much fun to watch, it could single-handedly reboot the genre.",The Matrix
Bill Gallo,"The Wachowskis seem to be saying that while state-of-the-art effects speak for themselves, loud and clear, there's still room amid all the kicking and shooting and shouting for the carefully observed human emotion.",The Matrix
Mike Clark,"Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge, over-elaborate cool and especially running time, it's just clever enough to enable [the Wachowskis] to nix the sophomore jinx following 1996's Bound.",The Matrix
Joe Morgenstern,"I know almost nothing of the intricate techniques that make The Matrix as eye-filling as it is brain-numbing, but I can tell you that... [its visuals] are wondrous to behold.",The Matrix
Katherine Monk,"If you're looking for a good spring fix of existentialist sci-fi, look no further than The Matrix -- then do everything you can to look deeper than the skin-tight surface.",The Matrix
Michael D. Reid,"Although it's sometimes too confounding for its own good and a little heavy on the Zen-inspired techno-babble, The Matrix is a consistently absorbing assault on the senses.",The Matrix
Manohla Dargis,"There's more form than content in The Matrix, but Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong.",The Matrix
Jack Mathews,Give [the Wachowskis] an A for effort and three A's for those effects. The Matrix is a dazzlingly original visual adventure.,The Matrix
Terry Lawson,"Casting the robotic Reeves as the hope of humanity may be this oppressively long, self-satisfied movie's funniest gag, but it doesn't really make the game any fun. It means we get stuck with the least interesting player.",The Matrix
Rene Rodriguez,"The Matrix's pleasures are considerable, but they're all purely visceral, too, lacking the mythology that would have elevated the movie. The movie is best taken as the first entry in a brand-new genre: post-modern sci-fi pulp.",The Matrix
Stephen Cole,How could filmmakers who are so skilled and imaginative lose themselves (and us) in what feels like a college stab at Aldous Huxley metaphysics?,The Matrix

Gary Wolcott,"Like last year's Dark City, the effects and storyline of The Matrix plow through enough fresh territory to make it worth seeing.",The Matrix
Ron Weiskind,"Visually, at least, The Matrix more than lives up to its billing. Writer-directors [the Wachowskis] seem to literally bring the screen to life with action scenes that define the word kinetic.",The Matrix
Jay Stone,"The Matrix isn't a film that is acted, exactly, but Reeves and Fishburne are both just swell and Weaving is a lot of fun as bad Agent Smith. And some of the small ideas are intriguing ones. They're the stuff of which sci-fi classics are made.",The Matrix
Elvis Mitchell,"It's rare, and kind of touching, really, to see a lushly financed studio spectacular work so hard to keep everyone's attention. And with enough symbolism to keep online chat rooms busier than the day Babylon 5 was cancelled.",The Matrix
Dennis King,"With pounding assurance, The Matrix scores as a real triumph of technical special-effects-driven filmmaking. Sad, though, that the Wachowskis end up letting the machines run away with the show.",The Matrix
KT Mahe,"Succinct filmmaking, satisfying performances and memorable dialogue assures Goodfellas position as a classic in the genre and Hollywood.",Goodfellas
Oti,"Goodfellas excels in detailing the protagonist's journey within the mob, with narration that enriches rather than detracts. Despite a slower final act, it remains gripping.",Goodfellas
Brian Eggert,"Goodfellas captures the pulse of gangster life, not just to understand what motivates these people and how they compartmentalize their choices, but to supply the audience with a shock treatment of aversion.",Goodfellas
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"It aged perfectly, even though many imitations have emerged in the last 33 years. In dealing with shades of grey, detestable but relatable characters, brutal violence and themes of family, friendship and crime, it feels timeless. Full review in Spanish.",Goodfellas
Michael Wilmington,"It's staggering: a feast of virtuoso Steadicam tracking shots, ironically pell-mell editing, and a mix of baroque visual satire, off-key realism, and brilliant, scabrous dialogue that elevates gutter badinage to the high verbal style of a Jacobean drama.",Goodfellas
Warren Sonbert,The only argument you’re bound to get into concerning Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas is the degree of its greatness -- if it’s the most brilliant cinematic tour de force of the decade or merely this year. After 10 minutes I felt I had already seen 25 films.,Goodfellas
Christopher Tookey,Scorsese constantly reveals the skull behind the smile. Seldom has violence been portrayed less glamorously or with more moral effectiveness.,Goodfellas
Terry Lawson,"It is intimately personal, yet so removed as to remain nonjudgmental, and therefore totally trustworthy. We give into it without reservation, because its maker assures us with every shot, every move that he knows exactly what he’s doing.",Goodfellas
David Denby,"GoodFellas, written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese, and directed by Scorsese, is the greatest film ever made about the sensual and monetary lure of crime, and the whole perversely brilliant movie comes into focus in a single, staggering shot.",Goodfellas
Joe Pollack,"Like everything Scorsese makes, it is crisp and clean, with exciting cinematography and superior acting. Despite its length, it is fast-moving and gripping. I walked away emotionally drained from more than two hours of tension.",Goodfellas
Kathleen Murphy,"We're taken in at our own risk, hooked on the film's speed, the power of its sights and sounds. Our nerve endings occasionally scream caveats... But we never doubt that a master at the top of his game is calling the shots.",Goodfellas
Tom Carson,"All that's on the screen is a showy, humorless vaunting of directorial technique, and misplaced technique at that. Scorsese sets up the material as comedy, but he seems to consider it beneath him to let viewers find any of it funny.",Goodfellas
Brian D. Johnson,"Funny and frightening, unpredictable and provocative, GoodFellas may be the most authentic Mafia picture ever made. The acting is superb, and so natural that no one -- least of all De Niro -- seems to be performing.",Goodfellas
Michael Sragow,"This working stiff's version of The Godfather is disappointing: It lacks depth and point of view, and a rich, sustained tone. The skin-deep style is voluptuous... But all that holds the story together is the parade of investigative revelations.",Goodfellas
Barbara Vancheri,"In a fall that promises four gangster films, GoodFellas bursts out of the gate like a derby-winning filly.",Goodfellas
Bill Cosford,"The simple fact, as exhilarating as it is dreadful, is that after a life of crime, Hill had but one regret -- that he had to stop. This is the engine of GoodFellas, an idea as elemental as it is radical.",Goodfellas
Hal Lipper,"Scorsese's GoodFellas is an unparalleled achievement, the most chilling and savagely droll account of mob life ever recorded on film.",Goodfellas
Jeff Simon,"The audience at GoodFellas spends a good deal of the movie exhilarated and laughing. It's a very funny movie, but most of the laughs are turned back on the audience. You don't get away with it.",Goodfellas
Mike McGrady,"With all the talent in this movie, singling out a specific performer seems capricious, but let me take a stab at it. I will grant you that De Niro is perfection... But let me reserve my loudest applause for Pesci.",Goodfellas
Alexander Walker,"They are treated like lab specimens, clinically normal looking, yet mutated by some corrupt gene into social monsters we'd rather not claim as our next of kin. All that dissuades one from making an early exit is Scorsese's magisterial detachment.",Goodfellas
Cory Woodroof,"We get so many movies that use up the space Dune: Part Two does, but a very, very few manage to do so much with a canvas like this. Much like the great sequels before it, this film is essential.",Dune: Part Two
Rob Hunter,"Villeneuve brings the epic scope, Zendaya brings the heart and humanity.",Dune: Part Two

Philip De Semlyen,"As a sequel, it works for the same reasons that make The Empire Strikes Back so many people’s favourite Star Wars film: there’s a darkness, a bleakness, that makes the fist-pumping moments feel all-the-more earned.",Dune: Part Two
Valerie Kalfrin,"...rich in multilayered world-building. While its dense story might leave some cold, this is a movie meant for big-screen grandeur, from the detailed costumes to the cinematography, special effects, and score.",Dune: Part Two
Joe Muldoon,"For much of its 167-minute runtime, the action builds itself up slowly but surely, teasingly incremental in its climb – but in its final act, Paul’s story hurtles its way towards a thunderous, earth-shattering climax.",Dune: Part Two
Jorge Rivera Rubio,A must watch! [Full review in Spanish],Dune: Part Two
Lee Zumpe,"The film is exquisitely beautiful and immersive, breathtaking in scope, and fearless in delivering stunning action sequences that are so vivid they practically erupt from the screen.",Dune: Part Two
Cody Leach,"Dune Part Two is bigger in almost every way. The visual effects, sound design, and production as a whole is immaculate. Narratively, it does feel a bit too unresolved by the end for my taste but hopefully Dune: Messiah comes sooner rather than later.",Dune: Part Two
Susan Granger,"Visually stunning yet sterile - with an emphasis on action, as opposed to exposition and character-development, resulting in a shallow, self-important sequel.",Dune: Part Two
Sarah Vincent,"If you are watching “Dune: Part Two” with the right mindset, i.e. from Chani’s point of view, you should be watching the film with growing dread and concerned about Paul, not cheering how everything is coming together.",Dune: Part Two
Tim Cogshell,"As different from the first film as [Ridley Scott's] Alien is to [James Cameron's] Aliens. Same stuff, totally different genre!",Dune: Part Two

Gavin Spoors,"Dune: Part Two improves upon its predecessor, thanks to a bigger focus on the Fremen, but its inclusiveness is still watered down.",Dune: Part Two
Reginald Ponder,“Dune: Part Two” is the type of film that will engross you with its beauty and complexity yet might confuse you at the same time. It is an epic tale worthy of the big-screen experience.,Dune: Part Two

John Cashman,One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest ultimately fails as black humor because it is too real for anyone who wants to think about it not to realize what is causing the laughter. Sick persons are not funny. And McMurphy may be the sickest of them all.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Danielle Solzman,Interstellar utilizes science in a way that strives for authenticity in a science-fiction thriller and it's why we're still discussing the Christopher Nolan film today.,Interstellar

Brian Eggert,Rarely do epics of this scope and intelligence reach theaters anymore; such serious commercial filmmaking seems like a market almost exclusively maintained by Christopher Nolan.,Interstellar
Josh Parham,"While not all-together perfect, the film represents a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves to be placed high within the caliber of Nolan’s filmography.",Interstellar

Jack Moffitt,Capra enriches his picture with sharp social satire and Dickensesque comments on human behavior. Those who are wearying of Scrooge and Bob Cratchit may find it a closer-to-home version of A Christmas Carol.,It's a Wonderful Life
Matt Neal,"Like a nice snifter of the Christmas brandy, it warms the heart and makes you feel good.",It's a Wonderful Life
Mike Massie,"Although it's regularly viewed as a prime example of director Capra's perspectives on the everyman and human ideals, it's a grand accomplishment in romantic comedy.",It's a Wonderful Life

Howard Waldstein,"If Akira Kurosawa's entire body of work is full of forays into different types of stories, then Seven Samurai marks the moment where all of his most pertinent themes coalesce into a single, three-and-a-half-hour film.",Seven Samurai
Austin Faricy,"As usual in a Kurosawa epic, the film is deliberate about getting started, but once the battle is joined, all is breakneck fury.",Seven Samurai

Dilys Powell,Seven Samurai is long; it is brutal; it is not always easy to follow. But it is magnificent.,Seven Samurai
Michael Roemer,One of the finest films ever made.,Seven Samurai
Dennis Harvey,"Seven Samurai is never dull, and it provided a model for future action movies in many ways—from its “assembling the team of fighters” narrative stretch to the proto-Peckinpah use of slow-motion in brutal action sequences.",Seven Samurai
Brian Eggert,"Seven Samurai is a spectacle of the human spirit, an interplay of hope and questions about the way of the world, and finally, an epic in which ideas and action converge with a remarkable, vital scope.",Seven Samurai
Peter Bradshaw,The glorious vigour and strength of this film is presented with such theatrical relish and flair: its energy flashes out of the screen like a sword.,Seven Samurai
Jack Parr,Absorbing as the story itself is it's the tremendous resourcefulness of Akira Kurosawa's direction (and probably his writing) which makes the picture a real work of art.,Seven Samurai
Marjory Adams,There are many excellencies in [Seven Samurai]. The acting of the men who are unknown to American audiences but whose talents are obvious; the careful building of suspense; the realism of the battle scenes... [and] the beauties of the countryside.,Seven Samurai
Hortense Morton (Screen Scout),The picture pyramids to high tension as traps are set for the anticipated marauders... Keystone of the drama is marvelous acting.,Seven Samurai

Helen Bower,[Seven Samurai ] rates my unqualified whoops of approval.,Seven Samurai
Jean Yothers,Those who enjoy a good wild Western will find this picture to be great sport.,Seven Samurai

Janet Graves,This sturdy tale of action pictures the Japan of centuries ago in one exquisite shot after another.,Seven Samurai
C.A. Lejeune,Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai deserves very careful study. Kurosawa directed Rashomon. The present film shows a marked development from the earlier picture.,Seven Samurai
Wendy Ide,The crux of this excellent thriller is the battle of intellect and wills between them [Clarice Starling and Dr Hannibal Lecter].,The Silence of the Lambs
Mark Johnson,"Suspenseful and shrewd, Hopkins’ Lecter is one of the most fascinating villains in film (despite less than 20 min of screen time). In spite of his contemptible reproach and steely demeanor, there’s just something about Lecter that makes us root for him.",The Silence of the Lambs
Terry Francis,"Most books, plays or films never give us even this much. Yet The Silence of the Lambs gives us so much that it's a shame the film doesn't find ways to deepen its concentration on the colossal aberrance of the minds of its complementary terrors.",The Silence of the Lambs

Jay Scott,A failure that is a function of its success.,The Silence of the Lambs
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"An exceptional thriller; a film that puts us in the shoes —and in the eyes— of its protagonist as very few other productions have managed to do, introducing us to a world of killers and cannibals and the FBI agents who chase them.

Kathy Huffhines,"Throughout the movie, Demme gets across more terror than a dozen Friday the 13ths by showing not the horrifying thing itself but the faces of people looking at horror.",The Silence of the Lambs
Warren Sonbert,"Grand Guignol is too mild an expression for a work in which every scene is an exercise in repulsion. But I couldn't wait for what happened next and would have to admit that this is an excellent, if morally reprehensible, film.",The Silence of the Lambs
Paul McKie,The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most intoxicating and absorbing thrillers ever made.,The Silence of the Lambs
Jim Emerson,"The Silence of the Lambs is something exceedingly rare and invaluable in movies these days: an accomplished, intelligent -- and genuinely scary -- thriller.",The Silence of the Lambs
Lawrence Toppman,"As played by Anthony Hopkins in the performance of his film career, the amoral psychiatrist dominates the picture -- a remarkable feat, since Jodie Foster is the top-billed star and also does a superb job.",The Silence of the Lambs
Michael MacCambridge,"The other thing that gives Silence its special charge is Hopkins' powerfully ingratiating performance as the formidable villain. Every second he's on the screen, you can't help but feel uncomfortable.",The Silence of the Lambs
Candice Russell,A bone-chiller of superior intensity.,The Silence of the Lambs
Michael H. Price,Scott Glenn's low-key portrayal keeps things anchored in normalcy and provides a scale against which the depths of Hopkins' malice and Foster's troubled nature can be measured.,The Silence of the Lambs
George Anderson,"As the old advertising campaign said, keep telling yourself it's only a movie. But what a movie! It is quite simply one of the very best of its kind.",The Silence of the Lambs
Eleanor O'Sullivan,"Even accepting that the movie's cruelty will be its calling card, there's still the void created by no clear point-of-view character. It's nobody's movie in particular, the opposite of Michael Mann's... Manhunter.",The Silence of the Lambs
Harper Barnes,"The Silence of the Lambs is the stuff that nightmares are made of. It is, in a sense, a horror movie, but one that deserves comparison with such great works of psychological terror as The Shining, Psycho and Rosemary's Baby.",The Silence of the Lambs
Wesley Lovell,"Not for the squeamish, “Saving Private Ryan” is a film that does not shy away from realistic violence and paints the most vivid portrait of war on film that I’ve seen.",Saving Private Ryan
Akos Peterbencze,"Saving Private Ryan’s most impressive and lasting feat remains its ability to remind us about the soldiers we lost — and more importantly, who they were as human beings.",Saving Private Ryan
Wendy Ide,The 24-minute sequence at the start of Steven Spielberg’s Second World War drama is one of the greatest pieces of combat cinema yet made.,Saving Private Ryan
Michael Clark,"Arguably Spielberg's most visceral and inspired work, Saving Private Ryan speaks to devout patriotism, sacrifice and unflappable camaraderie. Sadly, these might be ideals our currently politically-divided country might never see eye-to-eye on again.",Saving Private Ryan

Mike Massie,The opening moments on Omaha Beach are surely the most memorable of the entire film.,Saving Private Ryan
Leigh Paatsch,After a gut-wrenchingly graphic opening that re-stages the D-Day landing in a numbing fine detail - arguably the greatest war-movie scene of them all - it is impossible not to be caught up in this classic drama for the long haul.,Saving Private Ryan
Peter Bradshaw,"An old-fashioned war picture to rule them all - gripping, utterly uncynical, with viscerally convincing and audacious battle sequences.",Saving Private Ryan

Kent Garrison,"Spielberg is at his absolute best here, with the true stroke of genius being the camera work and editing.",Saving Private Ryan
Brian Gill,A masterpiece in every sense of the word .,Saving Private Ryan
Ed Travis,"Not simply a 1990s classic or among the better prestige films of my generation, Saving Private Ryan is a stone cold masterpiece ranking among the very best war films of all time.",Saving Private Ryan

Martin Chilton,"Steven Spielberg's film is not perfect: it plays its strongest card first, the middle section is slightly uneven, and there are sallies into sentimentality. But it is a modern war classic.",Saving Private Ryan

J. R. Jones,I came away from this film impressed by its narrative control but unmoved by anything it had to say.,City of God

Nell Minow,"Powerful, but only for 17 and up.",City of God
Nick Rogers,"Each chapter is endowed with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. What seem like innocuous turns become so critical to the narrative that they tie into the ruthless idea at hand: You never see the bullet that kills you.",City of God
Emanuel Levy,"Brazillian director Mereilles' splashy feature debut, a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio's violent gangs, immediately established himsef as an international talent to watch, and the Oscar nods only reaffirmed that status.",City of God
David Rooney,"City of God delivers a bruising, visceral experience of the vicious spiral of violence that draws kids into a life of crime, brutality and murder as the only avenue open to them.",City of God

Matt Brunson,There are several scenes of tremendous power. But the same problems that plagued The Shawshank Redemption are in full force here.,The Green Mile
Douglas Davidson,"Now, for the first time, Darabonts The Green Mile is available on 4K UHD with high-dynamic range, rejuvenating the drama, imbuing it with the visual energy to accompany its bittersweet narrative.",The Green Mile
Brian Eggert,"At times, you notice The Green Mile tugging your heartstrings. But aside from a moment or two over the course of three hours, the viewer gives in, entrenched in the proceedings and deeply affected by the spell of these characters.",The Green Mile
Danielle Solzman,Make no mistake that The Green Mile is powerful and draws on our emotions but the film is also too long.,The Green Mile
Kirk Honeycutt,"The simple fable can't stand such scrutiny. More pivotally, the weight given to each moment lends The Green Mile a ponderousness that works against the emotions the story seems to want to plug into.",The Green Mile
Rachel Wagner,Unfortunately the movie can never shake the uncomfortable and trope-filled premise.,The Green Mile
Lisa Alspector,"Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks turn the walls into windows.",The Green Mile
Nell Minow,"Thoughtful, intelligent movie for older teens.",The Green Mile

Richard Corliss,"To more than a few viewers, this one will feel like a life sentence.",The Green Mile
Unknown reviewer,"Though the film drifts off down some long blind alleys, when Darabont exercises discipline the result is highly effective.",The Green Mile
Rob Gonsalves,"Dotted with many fine moments, clotted with a few flabby ones.",The Green Mile
Emanuel Levy,"Overextending its welcome, Frank Darabont's film is the most commercially popular adaptation of a Stephen King novella, but it's also a slow, often dull prison drama.",The Green Mile
Derek Adams,"The supernatural elements carry an undeniable emotional charge, but the solution to the underlying murder mystery is disappointingly tidy and trite.",The Green Mile
Jeffrey M. Anderson,"Although The Green Mile is a satisfying and affecting movie, it's not The Shawshank Redemption -- not by a long shot.",The Green Mile
Ron Wells,One of the best prison films ever made.,The Green Mile
Jeffrey Overstreet,"This movie is being described as inspiring? To me it just seems morbid, melancholy, sad, and far too long.",The Green Mile

Mike Massie,"While bigger isn't always better, writer/director James Cameron's follow-up is genuinely bigger and better in nearly every way.",Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Richard Trenholm,James Cameron's update of his sci-fi action classic is a great night at the movies. Just don't expect it to change your mind about 3D.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Ed Travis,"Inarguably one of the greatest sequels ever made, Terminator 2 builds itself upon a few key ideas that upend the audience's expectations and work like gangbusters with industry-altering technological execution.",Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Sean Mulvihill,No matter how bad the sequels get they can't undo the greatness of Terminator 2. This is a movie that will live forever.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Alan French,Cameron's vision makes the engine go and shows why he is one of the best blockbuster directors ever.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Bryant Frazer,"Terminator 2 is genuinely reverential towards Arnold, gazing raptly upon his physical form and elevating his lack of affect to something like a Platonic ideal of masculinity.",Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Animal Johns,T2 truly attains the test of time with a fabulous story connected with smart and effective special effects that complement the story.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Dennis King,"With Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron has bested his own earlier effort with a sequel that takes the original themes, the darkly high-tech style and the cutting wit of his 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator and pumps the energy up to kinetic overload.",Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Jay Carr,"This time Mr. Heavy Metal is on the side of the good guys. Naturally, he isn't quite as much fun.",Terminator 2: Judgment Day
Mike Ryan,The main point to take away from this: Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (a) still great and (b) retroactively depressing because these characters all seem to be in a better situation than we are right now.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day

Andy Adams,"Back to the Future is one of the most entertaining films of the year from virtually every aspect: the performances of the cast and production crew, the tongue-in-cheek comedy, the special effects, etc.",Back to the Future
Rex Reed,"Lost in confusion, director Robert Zemeckis and co-scriptwriter Bob Gale don’t know how to end the far-out fantasy they’ve created, and the smell of an equally silly sequel permeates the air like a gas leak.",Back to the Future
Jeffrey Peterson,"Spirited Away reminds me of how our friends, our work family, or the people we pass by in life can become more familial than our blood relations.",Spirited Away
Carla Monfort,Spirited Away is one of those films that you have to see at least once in your life: a milestone in animation that shines both in form and substance. [Full review in Spanish],Spirited Away
Jordan Brooks,"A careful reframing of the typical coming-of-age narrative, Spirited Away displays a fondness those infinitely awkward years, while showing us all how important they were in making us who we are today.",Spirited Away
Brian Eggert,"As with every Miyazaki picture, Spirited Away wants to at once amaze and familiarize you with an impossible dream, but it remains unique within his oeuvre for cementing that narrative desire into the essential groundwork of the story.",Spirited Away
Kathryn Greenaway,Listen to Miyazaki's message. Be good. Be strong. Then sit back and bask in his brilliance.,Spirited Away
Rick Bentley,"Visually, this is a magnificent example of Japanese animation. The story is another matter. At times, the shifting plot is almost too complex for explanation.",Spirited Away

Eleanor O'Sullivan,"Spirited Away has all the hallmarks of great Japanese design and there are many, many moments of wit and breathtaking beauty.",Spirited Away
Sukhdev Sandhu,"The film is strewn with casual poetry. Its colors, often blue and green, are muted and weak, like a tear-spattered love letter.",Spirited Away
Jeet Heer,"All in all, Spirited Away is a better animated feature film than anything to come out of Disney in the last 50 years.",Spirited Away
Scott Von Doviak,"Spirited Away is no secondhand fairytale retread; it's a fully imagined universe, populated by wondrous beings and haunting landscapes.",Spirited Away
Kris Meen,Spirited away is so visually imaginative that it bears its thematic burden without ever seeming weighed down by it.,Spirited Away
Jeff Strickler,"The plot starts suffering from dèjá vu before it's even half over. There are only so many octopus men, stink spirits and pig people you can take before they all start to blend together.",Spirited Away
Robert W. Butler,"Backgrounds have been fashioned with the delicacy of fine water colors. But for all that, Spirited Away left me pretty cold. Emotionally it's remote; narratively it seems to always be circling and never landing.",Spirited Away

Charles Solomon,"A flower on the grave of all the children who have died needlessly in war. It is eloquent, moving, and beautiful.",Grave of the Fireflies
Jordan Brooks,"A gripping drama whose defiant youths refuse to bow to war, hunger and indifference, Grave of the Fireflies is a film for children to learn the harsh realities of life so that they can do all in their power to prevent the cycle from continuing.",Grave of the Fireflies
Adam Kempenaar,"It’s one thing to have a film really sadden you, but I also found it sublime in its beauty... [Setsuko and Seita's] happiness together is transcendent.",Grave of the Fireflies

David Nusair,...a well-made and heartfelt drama that's just not as engrossing as it should be.,Grave of the Fireflies

Wael Khairy,Masaki Kobayashi’s “Harakiri” illustrates the samurai code as a flawed system hiding behind a façade of honor and principle—it is undeniably the greatest anti-samurai film ever made.,Harakiri
Brian Eggert,The film’s condemnation of the lies systems of authority will tell to preserve their power and engrain their ideology is deeply felt and presented in a structure that leaves the viewer rife with indignation.,Harakiri
Michelle Kisner,"Both a thrilling character piece and a scathing take down of authority, Harakiri is a tour-de-force and a compelling look into the facade of institutions.",Harakiri
Roger Ebert,It would be wrong for me to reveal the details of the story Tsugumo tells. What I can say is that it is heartbreaking.,Harakiri
Donald J. Levit,The 1962 single masterpiece uses ploys of the written word in picturing the past and/or far away to criticize the present.,Harakiri
Michael Sragow,"The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; the director, Masaki Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights.",Harakiri

Leigh Paatsch,A movie where the getting-there (and the getting-away-with-it) is everything.,The Usual Suspects

Cinelandia Staff,Casablanca presents us with a film of extraordinary quality.  [Full review in Spanish],Casablanca
Keith Garlington,“Casablanca” captures and utilizes so many things well. There’s a high level of suspense. There’s a touch of humor. There is a great realization of wartime tensions. And right in the middle of it all is what may be the best romance in cinema history.,Casablanca
Dilys Powell,"Casablanca, in fact, is starry with talent, pictorially often lovely and directed with considerable spirit by Michael Curtiz.",Casablanca
Pauline Kael,"It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism, and you're never really pressed to take its melodramatic twists and turns seriously.",Casablanca
Josh Parham,"As soon as the main titles end, you are transported into a world filled with great performances and an incredibly sophisticated screenplay that takes advantage of every emotion you can think of.",Casablanca
Brian Eggert,"It continues to fascinate audiences in a way that is beyond explanation, except to resolve that the picture seems to result from and fully encompass that somewhat fantastical notion of Movie Magic.",Casablanca
Manny Farber,"Casablanca is as ineffectual as a Collier’s short story, but with one thing and another -- like Bergman, Veidt and Humphrey Bogart -- it is a pleasure of sorts.",Casablanca
T.C. Kemp,The plot is complicated in detail but clear in its issue; and it is in the presentation of the tortuous means by which the desperately-desired end is gained that the picture succeeds admirably.,Casablanca

Charlotte Harrison,"Some movies just have the perfect script, packed full of endlessly quotable lines that are effortlessly delivered by an extraordinary cast. A phenomenal movie, that everyone needs to have seen.",Casablanca
Virginia Wright,"Dooley Wilson gets his best screen role to date as Rick's piano player, and comes through with ease.",Casablanca
Sarah Brinks,"Casablanca walks a thin line between classic romance and cheesy, but it stays true to its course. It could have very easily steered right into cheesy and stayed there, but because Curtiz had a vision it doesn't go there.",Casablanca

Jana Monji,The French film is superior to the Hollywood remake although the problem of Orientalism is more prominent.,The Intouchables

Dennis Harvey,...by all accounts this is one case in which Miramax's meddling appears to have actually improved a film...,Cinema Paradiso
Matt Brunson,"The theatrical version is a movie of extraordinary passion. In the Director's Cut, it's still an excellent film, just not a transcendent one.",Cinema Paradiso
Patrick Gamble,"A celebration of cinema's communal experience, this lovingly crafted ode to the joys projected upon the silver screen is a touching celebration of moviegoing.",Cinema Paradiso
Mike Massie,"Although charming, its substance isn't overwhelmingly deep, serving more as a lighthearted, idealized, nostalgic coming-of-age tale than a stirring emotional investment.",Cinema Paradiso
Allen Almachar,"Ask me what it is about movies I love so much, and I'll tell you to see Cinema Paradiso for your answer.",Cinema Paradiso
Bruce C. Steele,"It's another clean, colorful community with an unreal sense of vitality, everyone playing a comfortable role in the neat storyline.",Cinema Paradiso
Tim Pulleine,Cinema Paradiso itself possesses enough command and self-conviction to demonstrate that movies can still manage to manifest an alternative universe.,Cinema Paradiso
Rachel Wagner,A treat.,Cinema Paradiso
Hilary Mantel,"Giuseppe Tornatore's film is a charming and gently humorous work of semi-autobiography, composed with an attentive painter's eye and a cinematic cross- referencing of images and motifs.",Cinema Paradiso
Adam Mars-Jones,"Giuseppe Tornatore, writer and director of Cinema Paradiso, knows that the way to make shameless wallowing palatable is to make no great claims for what you are resurrecting.",Cinema Paradiso

Henry Fitzherbert,"It looks lovely and is full of classic, memorable moments, including a tear-jerking finale.",Cinema Paradiso
Brian Viner,One of the most delightful and affecting of all movie endings.,Cinema Paradiso
Jeremy Carr,"Emblematic of a ‘Hollywood realism,’ with a rather immaculate industrial setting, strategically tattered clothing and deliberately designed destitution.",Modern Times
Sean Axmaker,The surreal scene of Chaplin being wound through the gears of the factory machinery remains one of the most iconic images in film history: the little guy who manages not to get ground up in the machine.,Modern Times
Brian Eggert,Modern Times was Chaplin's last brilliant foray into that singular craft that made him a great artist: a pantomime.,Modern Times
Rob Aldam,Chaplin at his most inventive and ingenious.,Modern Times
Cameron Meier,"It's the greatest comedy - and funniest movie - of all time. ... But, as with most of Chaplin's other films, it'll also make you cry your eyes out.",Modern Times
Ella H. McCormick,"Several high spots stand out as notable examples of Chaplin's expert timing of slapstick burlesque, scenes that are apt to make the spectator shed tears from the strain of laughter.",Modern Times
Ada Hanifin,"The sequence in which the modern mechanical feeder for workers is introduced is a gem of comedy invention. It is one of the funniest episodes, and certainly the most ingenious.",Modern Times
Mildred Martin,There are reminders of every Chaplin picture that was ever made all through Modern Times and there are enough brand new comic inventions to explain why Charlie takes such a long time between pictures and why they are so superlatively worth waiting for.,Modern Times
Mae Tinee,"What most amazes you about Modern Times, is the fact that, in this day of superfine sound films, it says everything without saying anything.",Modern Times
Marjory Adams,"In many ways Modern Times is old-fashioned film comedy, but it is the kind of comedy which has made millions of people laugh all over the world and which has won Mr. Chaplin the great affection and love.",Modern Times
Kate Cameron,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain.",Modern Times
Josephine O'Neill,"Modern Times, underneath its farce, is a curiously passionate jibe at the herd-instincts and herd clangour of a machine age.",Modern Times
Elinor Ragin,"The monotony of this Job ""gets"" Charlie and he runs wild, attacking everything and everybody in view with his brandished wrenches in one of the funniest scenes ever filmed.",Modern Times
Marion Aitchison,"Miss Goddard put us in mind more of a ballet dancer in portraying her role than a screen player, which fits in, on the whole, rather well with Chaplin's style. She's attractive and has charm.",Modern Times
Harold V. Cohen,"It is episodically hilarious but never consistently so, and you come away from the Penn remembering, not so much the heroic Chaplinesque figure as a nut-and-bolt factory, a red flag, a feeding machine and a song.",Modern Times
James T. Hamada,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others.",Modern Times
E. de S. Melcher,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.,Modern Times
Picture Parade,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed.",Modern Times
P.S. Harrison,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing.",Modern Times
Winston Burdett,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one.",Modern Times
Erick Estrada,A clear game of suspense. [Full review in Spanish],Rear Window
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"Mixing drama, with a bit of dry comedy, and the thriller elements to which Hitchcock had accustomed us, ""Rear Window"" is one of the best films of his filmography, and an interesting metatextual commentary on voyeurism. Full review in Spanish.",Rear Window
Danielle Solzman,The Oscar-nominated Rear Window isn't just one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the greatest thrillers ever made.,Rear Window

Wendy Ide,Perhaps the most elegant and satisfying of Alfred Hitchcock’s thrillers...,Rear Window
Keith Garlington,It’s straightforward and mysterious at the same time and features characters that are more complex than they appear on the surface.,Rear Window
Matt Neal,"Psycho may be more daring and thrilling (and ultimately better), and Vertigo certainly has its fans for its unique stylings and deep themes, but Rear Window is the quintessential Hitchcock film.",Rear Window
Wesley Lovell,"One of the defining characteristics of Alfred Hitchcocks cinematic oeuvre is his constant need to innovate and iterate on ideas, taking audiences to new and compelling places. Rear Window is not his most ambitious gimmick, but it is his most successful.",Rear Window
Russ Burton,Hitchcock has improved on most of his other efforts by giving a depth to the pure action line with the addition of a sincere lose element and a comedy line which runs like a warm current just under the surface of the tension.,Rear Window
Terry Hiller,It's a great movie and it's a chance in a million to see a passionate Grace Kelly... She had so much class it would be easy to overlook that underlying heat which Hitchcock let play in this film.,Rear Window
C.A. Lejeune,"It is taut, exact, well-patterned; technically bang on; never lets the attention go. Hitchcock is a director who has always revelled in contrasts; nothing delights him more than to smother his ice-cream with lashings of hot chocolate sauce.",Rear Window
Harper Barnes,"Rear Window builds in a much more linear way, slowly creating tension bit by bit until the chilling final 10 minutes. It takes a long time to get there, but there is literally never a dull moment.",Rear Window
John Monaghan,"Sure, Vertigo is more personal, Psycho more bizarre, North by Northwest more thrilling. But Rear Window shows the Master of Suspense at his most spare, sophisticated and sinisterly clever a movie that is essentially about watching movies.",Rear Window
Dave Kehr,"The most densely allegorical of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, moving from psychology to morality to formal concerns and finally to the theological. It is also Hitchcock's most innovative film in terms of narrative technique.",Rear Window
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best -- a hugely entertaining, romantic and witty film with just a touch of mayhem.",Rear Window
Peter Travers,"Hitchcock condemned the invasive immorality of voyeurism without for a second denying its allure. In terms of art and entertainment, he knew better than any movie director that there's no percentage in minding your own business.",Rear Window
Joseph Gelmis,"Rear Window works as well today as it did when Alfred Hitchcock made it in 1954. Since none of his legion of imitators can match the master's touch, Rear Window is a cultural reference point against which to recalibrate our critical standards.",Rear Window
Jane Corby,"The suspense accumulates until it reaches a point when the whole picture seems electrically charged. It is this desultoriness, with the accompanying attention to small angles of the story that helps to make It full-bodied, adult entertainment.",Rear Window
Marion Aitchison,"Easily the most unusual and surely one of the most absorbing pictures of many months, Rear Window is suspense drama at its best The fact that it was made by Alfred M. Hitchcock guarantees that.",Rear Window
Lillian Blackstone,"One of the best in the cast is Thelma Ritter, insurance company nurse who pays Stewart daily visits. Wendell Corey is excellent; so is Raymond Burr, the menace in this picture.",Rear Window
Sean Burns,Leone’s gloriously inflated epic isn’t just any old Western. It’s all of them.,Once Upon a Time in the West
Zita Short,"It is rare to find a Western that is so immersive, even when the characters aren’t as complex as they could be.",Once Upon a Time in the West
Brian Eggert,"Self-aware in every respect, from his dynamic framing to the prolonged showdowns, Leone's meticulous style may distance some viewers from making an emotional connection to his work, but striking dramatic chords is hardly his principal intention.",Once Upon a Time in the West

Michael Ventura,This thing scared the shit out of me. Alien's a masterpiece of fright.,Alien

Roy Peter Clark,"Ridley Scott's new film Alien, destined to become the scary smash of summer, returns us to our senses. Our bad dreams [about extraterrestrials] were right.",Alien
David Denby,"Alien, like the Exorcist, works on your nerves and emotions with the practiced hand of a torturer extracting a confession. The movie is terrifying, but not in a way that is remotely enjoyable.",Alien
Charles Champlin,"You are in for jolts, shocks and some fairly gruesome and shuddering sights. With only his second feature, Ridley Scott has emerged as a major film maker. What he has to say is still not clear, but he certainly knows how to say it effectively.",Alien
Bill Cosford,"There are no moral choices, no Deer Hunter ambiguity or Midnight Express propaganda. There is only the quandary over whether to stick it out until the end, edge of the seat and all, or bolt for the exits and a dreamless sleep. Alien is very scary.",Alien
Stephen Schiff,"There hasn't been a monster movie this scary since Jaws, and nothing else in the science-fiction genre can touch it; it turns your muscles into coleslaw. It's also kind of dumb.",Alien
Stanley Kauffmann,"The plot as such is quickly tedious, not only because it's a stale ritual but because it gets repeated several times... A three-minute set of clips from the picture would make a good spine-tingler.",Alien
Walter V. Addiego,"Scott seems ponderous about getting through simple plot mechanics... But for those who like this kind of film, he's produced something like the equivalent of every amusement park ride rolled into one.",Alien
Robert W. Butler,We've seen it all before. What sets this movie well above its competitors in the hair-raising derby is its technical polish and the imagination with which director/cinematographer Ridley Scott and his production crew have visualized the spaceship.,Alien
Dean Johnson,"Scott has the commercialist's feel for economy, and if the film doesn't say much, the director makes up for a void of message with a stunning visuality.",Alien
Gary Arnold,"Sigourney Weaver is the only newcomer in the cast, but her movie debut may generate instant stardom. Weaver... is an experienced theater actress, and she brings an exciting combination of intelligence, bravery and sex appeal.",Alien
Dilys Powell,Alien is far from the customary exercise in disgust; it is a thriller which makes its points through passages of horror -- by my reckoning three passages; and the tension is enjoyable because so much is left to the imagination.,Alien
Lawrence O'Toole,"Often unintentionally funny, plotted more for convenience than sense, motivated by nothing other than money, Alien is expensive, silly, schlock.",Alien
Sean Axmaker,"... it borders on maudlin at times, but the rest mixes heartbreak and hardship with slapstick and spirited gags, all with the grace we’ve come to expect of cinema’s silent comic poet.",City Lights
Zita Short,That famous final scene didn’t leave me crying my eyes out because the two main characters were thinly drawn archetypes and their bond did not seem to mean anything,City Lights
Carson Timar,"Charlie Chaplin is a film auteur who's career boils down to two sides, that of comedy and that of personal statement. City Lights remains one of the strongest collaborations between the two.",City Lights
Brian Eggert,"City Lights may be Charles Chaplin's most personal motion picture, or perhaps the film's heightened measure of emotion just makes it feel that way.",City Lights

Chris Stuckmann,"Chaplin and his cast have crafted a silent film that is drastically funny, extremely well-shot and still holds up today...this is a labor of love, for sure, but the end result is a classic that has held the test of time.",City Lights
Irene Thirer,"""City Lights"" is excruciatingly funny and terribly, terribly sad. It makes you chuckle hysterically. You have the greatest time imaginable, and yet, occasionally you find little hurty lumps in your throat.",City Lights
Dan Jardine,"City Lights is a paean to our best impulses, a plea for humanitarianism and justice.",City Lights
Matt Brunson,"No filmmaker has ever been as successful as Chaplin in tugging at our heartstrings while simultaneously leaving us helpless in laughter, and this gem finds him operating at the peak of his abilities, even throwing his usual social critique into the mix.",City Lights

Andrew Bloom,"From the jump, Apocalypse Now conveys the sense of a man riddled with PTSD, who's all but lost himself in the trauma.",Apocalypse Now
Sarah Brinks,"The performances in the film are very strong. Martin Sheen is very good in the film. He plays things pretty close to the vest but the voiceover gives us a clear view into his thinking, fears, and insecurities.",Apocalypse Now
Rachel Wagner,I see why it is considered one of the great films of the 1970s.,Apocalypse Now
Richard Propes,Apocalypse Now is the kind of film that makes me thank God I fell in love with cinema.,Apocalypse Now
Mike Massie,"Artistically, it's quite reminiscent of film noir, with an abundance of deep shadows, a desolate voiceover by Willard, and a cast of morally unstructured antiheroes.",Apocalypse Now
Tom Meek,One of the great films of the (arguably) greatest decade in American cinema...,Apocalypse Now
Allen Almachar,"It was made through a combination of fear and determination, ending with an experience that is frightening, thought provoking, and brilliant.",Apocalypse Now

Jesús Fernández Santos,"This monumental apocalypse of napalm and helicopters ends up being a total spectacle of war, rarely achieved in film. [Full Review in Spanish]",Apocalypse Now
Armond White,"Although Apocalypse Now is not a great movie, it shows a still-impressive, politically inspired ambition -- a reminder of why film culture matters... Mixing pessimism with astonishment, it expanded cultural unease on a grand 70mm scale.",Apocalypse Now
Veronica Geng,"It has coherence, truthfulness, and conviction-up to a point.",Apocalypse Now
Michael Wood,"The film holds together well enough until it reaches its final muddle, and it has scenes and moments unequaled in recent European or American movies.",Apocalypse Now

John Brhel,"It might not be the most innovative in Tarantino’s oeuvre, but it’s got real stakes and memorable characters one can root for. Django is packed with Tarantino’s postmodern trademarks, but it also has the added value of actually addressing serious issues.",Django Unchained
Danielle Solzman,"In Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino brings his revisionist style to the Spaghetti Western in one of his most violent movies to date.",Django Unchained
Brian Eggert,"Quentin Tarantino continues to play with history and cinematic tradition in Django Unchained, his self-proclaimed “Southern” whose deposits of blaxploitation and Spaghetti Western filmmaking engage a violent saga of revenge and historical atrocity.",Django Unchained
Keith Garlington,"The good moments are really good, but each of them are bookended by one questionable narrative choice or a blast of QT style that doesn’t always help the film as a whole.",Django Unchained
Danilo Castro,It's a fun but flawed film on the cusp of mastery that comes up slightly short.,Django Unchained
Erick Estrada,"Two Tarantinos directed each a half of the film, a dizzying way of telling a dizzying story, all of it to bring the western apocalypse, referencing Kill Bill (USA, 2003) and culminating with and ending that is so pop culture... [Full review in Spanish]",Django Unchained
Jason Adams,"I think to myself that ""disappointed"" is a strong word for it. But it's not. Pieces work but somehow the movie just really didn't gel.",Django Unchained
Toussaint Egan,"Packed with thrilling gunfights, tense drama, memorable quippy dialogue, and an impressive collection of breakout performances (minus Tarantino's weird cameo), Django Unchained easily ranks among the very best films Tarantino has ever produced.",Django Unchained
Kip Mooney,Gutsy and entertaining.,Django Unchained
Tony Black,"Django is another example of Tarantino looking at cultural American history through the lens of privilege, twisting truth and fiction through a grotesque, funhouse mirror.",Django Unchained
David Walsh,"Django Unchained is a miserable work, implausible and unconvincing from beginning to end (unlike the best ""spaghetti Westerns"" Tarantino claims to admire).",Django Unchained

Richard Propes,There's a lot of lunacy in Django Unchained.,Django Unchained
Allen Almachar,"Django Unchained may cross the line in its excess, but all the while, it remains consistently riveting up to its spectacular end.",Django Unchained
Brent McKnight,"Tarantino accomplishes what he set out to do, make a fun, violent, badass spaghetti western. He brings together the classic aesthetics of the genre, with his modern, pop culture saturated sensibilities, and his whip smart dialogue.",Django Unchained
Yasser Medina,Is another great film from Tarantino that reflects the level of maturity his cinema has reached. [Full review in Spanish],Django Unchained
David Lamble,A loose-cannon Best Picture pick.,Django Unchained
Anne Thompson,"Tarantino designed this revisionist western to blow people's gaskets. Packed with physical comedy, bloody action and hell-bent revenge, it looks like a classic widescreen Sergio Leone western...",Django Unchained
Katie Smith-Wong,Django is another gem in Tarantino's crown.,Django Unchained
Akhil Arora,"Memento places you in the mind of the protagonist in a fascinating way—by running it in reverse, you only know as much as the protagonist remembers—and that constantly makes you question what you’ve been told and what you see next.",Memento
Eddie Harrison,…one of the most demanding movies ever made…one of cinema’s most ornate puzzle-boxes…,Memento
Victoria Luxford,"Very complex detective thriller. Guy Pearce (leads) a terrific cast alongside Carrie Anne Moss. If you want to see the beginnings of how Nolan became such a big director, this is one to watch.",Memento
Paul Kanieski,"Memento ends as brilliantly as it begins, merging the two disparate timelines into one, and leaving us with a disquieting insight into human nature – that even fundamentally good people can gaslight themselves.",Memento
Cory Woodroof,"Nolan’s sophomore feature remains one of his most scintillating works, a noir for the ages draped in the pain of memories half-remembered and a future fully dependent on the past.",Memento
Danielle Solzman,"Christopher Nolan's sophomore feature, Memento, may confuse audiences with its non-linear narrative but it's every bit as thrilling.",Memento
Amy Bracken Sparks,"Directed by Christopher Nolan based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this is an intellectual exercise that's unlike anything you've seen lately.",Memento
Fico Cangiano,A nifty puzzle worth assembling. The film that put Nolan on the map. A psychological film noir breakthrough. [Full review in Spanish],Memento

Tom Meek,The brain-teasing mystery put Christopher Nolan on the map as a filmmaking force...,Memento
Richard Propes,Pearce is positively astounding.,Memento
Siddhant Adlakha,"Nolan's winding timelines and practical stunts are marvels to behold, but they seldom compare to the slow push-in on Leonard's face, as brief but powerful bursts of memory envelop the screen.",Memento
Adam Kempenaar,"Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has.",Memento
Ed Travis,"Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering.",Memento
Joshua Rothkopf,"Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds.",Memento
C.J. Prince,Memento isn't just a film with a twist ending; its scatterbrained storytelling literally keeps you guessing with every scene.,Memento
David Nusair,Christopher Nolan's cinematic breakthrough...,Memento
Gilbert Adair,"If the prospect of having to do some of the work yourself doesn't alarm you, then Nolan's first American film is well worth catching, a thriller which is for once authentically Borgesian, to use an overworked qualifier.",Memento
Joe Morgenstern,"I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.",Memento
Jack Mathews,Writer-director Christopher Nolan's second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects.,Memento
Jimmy Cage,"12TH FAIL is a nicely told, touching underdog success story. Well played and technically at a high level. But it also focusses a bit too much on its inspirational note and I struggle to fully accept its message and worldview.",12th Fail
Akhil Arora,"[The movie loves romanticising struggle and is] willing to glorify everything and be like keep struggling — his motto is 'repeat, repeat.' What do you mean [by] repeat? For what objective? To what end?",12th Fail
Tatsam Mukherjee,"Above all, 12th Fail is a paean to Vikrant Massey’s astronomical amounts of sincerity.",12th Fail

Germain Lussier,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie so well-made and confident it didn’t need to have a sequel, but we’re sure glad it did.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Matt Brunson,"One of the all-time greats. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond).",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Don Shanahan,Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the ideal mold for action movies for the generation that followed.,Raiders of the Lost Ark
Chase Hutchinson,"From the moment we meet the iconic adventurer all the way to its glorious finale, it remains one of the most fun times one could have at the movies. One only wishes modern action-adventure films had one iota of the craft and creativity of this one.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Vincent Canby,"To get to the point immediately, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Roger Ebert,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later -- breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
John Brosnan,"A glorious mixture of spectacular, fast-paced action and sly humor.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Sheila Benson,"There was the almost exhausting excitement of the film itself. And at the same time a second emotion, a rush of gratitude which almost brought tears for the contagious joy and -- not to be corny about this -- the strength of the film's positive vision.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"Raiders is the most fun to hit the screen since movies came in chapters. Reportedly, there are further adventures of Indiana Jones in the works. Let's hope so. Something this good deserves To Be Continued.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Patrick Taggart,"It is, in short, a reminder of the very reason we go to movies. With its larger-than-life, wide screen images, the rich stereo sound, films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark are what will save the movie theater business from the video invasion.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Gary Arnold,"It is a transcendent blend of heroic exploits, cliffhangers and chases distilled with nostalgia and wit from the pulp thrillers, comic books and Republic serials of the World War II era.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Arthur Knight,"It's all done with such a great spirit of high adventure and good humor that you don't even begin to count the corpses... The finale suggests that Ford's Indiana Jones character will soon be back with further adventures, and I'm all in favor of it.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Gene Siskel,"Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Vern Stefanic,"After watching just the first five minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, you’re hooked. You’re held captive in a action-packed world of adventure and romance and you can’t turn away because the thrills keep coming faster and faster, bigger and better.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Joe Pollack,"Harrison Ford, who was Han Solo in Lucas' Star Wars, plays Jones in a hat and a generally unshaven condition that makes him look a great deal like the late Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Terry Orme,To say the Raiders of the Lost Ark is action-packed is to understate the case. There is hardly a scene that does not take your breath away.,Raiders of the Lost Ark
Jack Garner,"Raiders is as snappy as the crack of a whip, as daring as a leap over a snake-infested ravine, as rowdy as a fistfight in a grimy bar in Nepal, and as much fun as you could ever want in a film.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Bruce R. Miller,"[Raiders of the Lost Ark] is destined for some kind of popcorn immortality. Rare in this world of one-shot communication, it makes one want to see it again and again. Without question, it's the best film of the summer.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Joseph Gelmis,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a heady mixture of high adventure, street-smart humor and hardboiled romance in the midst of nonstop lethal battles between the forces of -- yes -- good and evil.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Sumner Rand,"John Williams, who wrote the atmospheric musical backgrounds for Star Wars and Empire, has succeeded again for Raiders.",Raiders of the Lost Ark
Sean Axmaker,"'The Lives of Others' is dark, but burning beneath the scathing political exposé of the GDR’s despotic paranoia and the personal tragedy of the drama is a bracing story of idealism, disillusionment, and defiance.",The Lives of Others
Brian Susbielles,It is an exceptional piece of intrigue in the deepest shades of gray in which the culture of fear of being spied on was deeply heightened.,The Lives of Others
Victor Pineyro,"In an on itself the film is about freedom, love, compassion, solitude, and everything that gets downtrodden in an oppression regime. An incredible paradox around obsession disguised as a film. [Full review in Spanish]",The Lives of Others
David Walsh,"One must point out there is a right-wing and a left-wing critique of Stalinism and the GDR, the opposite of genuine socialism.",The Lives of Others
Ard Vijn,"The actors are marvelous, with special mention of Ulrich Muhe who plays Wiesler. He gives a chilling portrayal of a man reluctantly driven to something approaching heroism.",The Lives of Others
Mattie Lucas,"Examines the effects of watching and being watched, both willingly and unwillingly, and turns them into a fascinating work of pure cinematic poetry.",The Lives of Others
Shubhra Gupta,"As [Captain Gerd] Weisler discovers his real self, layer by layer, we are in the presence of a masterful performance.",The Lives of Others
Namrata Joshi,"Donnersmarck makes an assured debut, builds the atmosphere of deceit, suspicion and suffocation and also undercuts it with some jokey moments.",The Lives of Others
Christy Lemire,"The Lives of Others is exquisitely tense, with massive stakes and a pervasive sense of danger.",The Lives of Others
Timothy Garton Ash,"It uses the syntax and conventions of Hollywood to convey to the widest possible audience some part of the truth about life under the Stasi, and the larger truths that experience revealed about human nature.",The Lives of Others
Richard Porton,Cinematic smugness has a fatal impact on the delineation of Wiesler's quietly heroic political calisthenics and The Lives of Others' supposedly uplifting denouement.,The Lives of Others
Dorothy Woodend,"The worst crime that this film has to offer is pure old simple dumbness, paper-thin characters, and a plot that leans heavily on artiness to give it the look of a more serious thinking story.",The Lives of Others
David Gritten,Reopens our eyes to the cruelties and soul assassinations that were carried out daily in the name of state socialism.,The Lives of Others
David Fear,,The Lives of Others
Hank Sartin,,The Lives of Others
Josh Larsen,The scope is especially impressive given that the movie is about a society obsessively focused on the tiniest of details.,The Lives of Others

Nick Rogers,"Activism proves tough on people who've thrived at their political patrons' blessings, and one character cruelly chooses a path of least resistance when the chips are down. A cataclysmic conclusion depicts political clamps on expression and emotion.",The Lives of Others
Rob Nelson,"If the filmmaker commits a crime, it's in pushing the [Stasi] character's rehabilitation slightly too far--about as much as the weight of a teardrop.",The Lives of Others
Geoff Berkshire,A truly unforgettable movie.,The Lives of Others
Dennis Harvey,"Paths of Glory was too sobering to be a popular success, but it established Kubrick as a leading director.",Paths of Glory
Kevin Maher,The director Stanley Kubrick and the producer-star Kirk Douglas anticipated the countercultural energy of the 1960s with this angry anti-war parable.,Paths of Glory
Anton Bitel,"...the real enemy here is the French officer class who, from their opulently appointed chateau, use infantry as pawns in pursuit of personal promotion and in covering up of their own highly consequential failures.",Paths of Glory
Roger Moore,"A brisk and biting World War I anti-war film, a politicized combat movie that reset the standard for trench warfare movies.",Paths of Glory
Matt Brunson,"Arguably the greatest antiwar film ever made, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory feels like a mule kick to the stomach no matter how many times one has seen it (in my case, too many to recall).",Paths of Glory
Keith Garlington,The film also excels thanks to Kubrick’s visual choices particularly his decision to shoot in black and white. It is perfect considering the harshness of the material and the morally murky waters we navigate through.,Paths of Glory
Danielle Solzman,"Language issues notwithstanding, Stanley Kubrick certainly knows what he's doing with Paths of Glory.",Paths of Glory
Dilys Powell,"Mr. Kubrick has not been able to inject into figures which are literary and alien from the rough vitality which so naturally flowed [in The Killing]. Nevertheless, Paths of Glory in its authority, its piercingness, is an extraordinary film.",Paths of Glory
Victor Pineyro,I can't even begin to imagine how Kubrick made this movie. I was perplexed the entire time. An absolute masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish],Paths of Glory
Brian Eggert,The directors most humanist film.,Paths of Glory
Jonathan Baumbach,"At any time, fashionable or not, it is a disturbing plea against the horror and senselessness of war.",Paths of Glory
André Bazin,"Paths of Glory is finally a captivating work, both weakened and reinforced by its Americanism -- but a very diluted, Hollywood Americanism, at that, and therefore something of a positive force in the end.",Paths of Glory
P.S. Harrison,"The subject matter is fictional, but it has been handled so realistically that one feels as if he is witnessing a real-life occurrence.",Paths of Glory
Moira Walsh,"Stanley Kubrick brings a controlled power to his direction of the uncompromisingly grim events, and Kirk Douglas, who produced the film, finds a most congenial role as an uncorrupted French colonel fighting for his men.",Paths of Glory
Janet Graves,Flashes of angry humor and a final gleam of hope relieve grimness.,Paths of Glory
Harold Whitehead,That is the shocking story and it is told with a stark realism that quite literally gives one the shivers.,Paths of Glory
Matthew Rozsa,"For those who like to contemplate politics and philosophy through well-written narrative drama, it is a welcome distraction.",Paths of Glory
Sarah Brinks,I usually don't respond to Stanley Kubrick's films positively but I was moved by Paths of Glory and am very happy to have had the chance to see it.,Paths of Glory
Mike Massie,"An eye-opening, thought-provoking, powerful war picture that isn't so much anti-war as it is anti-politics, anti-corruption, and anti-authoritarianism.",Paths of Glory

Jennifer Bisset,Who says all superhero films are predictable?,Avengers: Infinity War

Keith Garlington,"It’s a thrilling, funny, emotional, rip-roaring crowd-pleaser that serves as a fitting culmination of their decade-long buildup.",Avengers: Infinity War
Tony Black,"Infinity War is all about balance, in many different respects. Balance and tone, both of which, for a film with such ambition and size, are remarkable in how well they are executed.",Avengers: Infinity War
Brian Eggert,"The audience is left drained, albeit thrilled, and as every great MCU title does, it leaves us hotly anticipating the next chapter.",Avengers: Infinity War
Cory Woodroof,"The grand Marvel Cinematic Universe team-up has been out for a few weeks now, and just about everyone from Ben Garland to Zsa Zsa the now-fired Buccaneers Parrot has probably seen this giganto box office muncher of epic proportions.",Avengers: Infinity War
Taylor Baker,Episode 7: Globalism,Avengers: Infinity War
Hosea Rupprecht,"Thanks to the superb visual effects, the film is truly a work of art, even if it tries to pack in just a little too much, making some characters more like afterthoughts rather than integral to the plot.",Avengers: Infinity War
Kip Mooney,"I'm torn on the big finale. This is either the gutsiest ending of any modern blockbuster, or a prelude to an emotional cop-out.",Avengers: Infinity War
Nicholas Oon,"If you are remotely interested and if you remotely enjoyed the films of the MCU, this is a must watch. The Russo brothers have done it again.",Avengers: Infinity War

Jeffrey Zhang,"The Russo brothers deliver an epic, brutal, and oftentimes scattered showdown with the Mad Titan Thanos.",Avengers: Infinity War
Kshitij Rawat,Avengers: Infinity War is full of entertaining little parts that somehow do not make a compelling whole. It is a phantasmagoria of stunning action sequences and beautifully poignant moments that nevertheless leaves one cold in the end.,Avengers: Infinity War
Mike Massie,"There's nothing new about Marvel's money-raking formula, but as each new chapter comes along, the serialized story becomes more and more unwieldy.",Avengers: Infinity War
Caroline Cao,"As long as there’s creative juice for this world, any follow-up would feel inspired. It’s a tough act to follow; it’s difficult to outshine one of the most multidimensional animation films of the decade.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Mike Massie,"It’s yet another example of a generic, forgettable superhero story catering almost exclusively to sci-fi action, entirely ignoring whether or not it feels coherent or meaningful.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Tina Kakadelis,"Why the majority of superhero movies chose gloomy color palettes instead of Technicolor ones like Spider-Verse will never make sense. Ultimately, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a shining example of what a superhero movie can be.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Cory Woodroof,"Perhaps the most important animated film to come out in the last decade, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a renaissance of sorts for the artform.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Jennifer Bisset,"Over 140 animators combined computer animation with a hand-drawn style to mimic a comic book look. Inventive visuals, fresh storytelling and embracing the comic books' wackiness helped make the first non-white Spider-Man one of the best.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Kate Boyle,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a fantastic film.  It is a great coming-of-age story that teaches us we are all unique and that’s what makes us great.,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Joseph Garcia,"What they have here is something special. Not only does it look unique, but it also feels very forward-thinking in terms of animation.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Jeffrey Harris,"The film works as a refreshing origin story for Miles Morales, and the filmmakers offer a unique visual style that's never really been seen before in a CG-animated picture.",Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Keith Garlington,But then you run into the storytelling – a frustrating swirl of highs and lows that shortchanges its most interesting component and emotional core.,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse

Clayton Dillard,"The film is an alchemic triumph of effortless story execution, pinpoint humor, and acting masterclass.",Witness for the Prosecution
Matt Brunson,"Along with 1945’s And Then There Were None, this is the greatest of all the Agatha Christie adaptations that have been brought to the screen.",Witness for the Prosecution

Tim Dirks,"Witness for the Prosecution (1957) is co-writer and director Billy Wilder's brilliant film, with crisp dialogue, a complicated and intriguing plot, unique characters and excellent acting performances. It was a convoluted, twisting courtroom drama-mystery",Witness for the Prosecution

Danielle Solzman,...Witness for the Prosecution is one of the best courtroom dramas in cinematic history.,Witness for the Prosecution

Rob Aldam,it's Laughton who is afforded free reign to explore his character and demonstrates impeccable comic timing.,Witness for the Prosecution
Martyn Conterio,"Laughton knocks it out of the park as Robarts, and his scenes with real-life missus Lanchester are hysterical.",Witness for the Prosecution

Ken Hanke,"Every time the story strays from Sir Wilfrid, the interest level goes down a notch. Fortunately for the viewer, it doesn't get away from him very long at any point.",Witness for the Prosecution
Noel Murray,"Witness For The Prosecution has the pace and patience of live theater, but not the look. Wilder doesn't get overly flashy with camera moves and angles, but he does shift positioning subtly and effectively.",Witness for the Prosecution

Manuel São Bento,"The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all time. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years.",The Shining

Jay Scott,Kubrick sabotages his own thesis in the most knuckleheaded way conceivable: we can't be charged as accomplices in horror when there is no horror.,The Shining
John Brosnan,"Kubrick, however, doesn't really seem interested in the ""shining"" or in the hotel's supernatural forces generally... The result is a movie fatally flawed artistically.",The Shining
Cody Dericks,An unending roller coaster of terror that knows exactly how to get under the skin of anyone who watches it.,The Shining
David Denby,"There are a few terrific thrills, and some eerie moments of dislocation that only Kubrick could achieve, but most of the movie is unfelt, unscary, and bizarrely heavy-handed. It's the first pompous haunted-house movie.",The Shining
Brian Eggert,"The terrifying aspect of The Shining, and its most enduring quality, is how Kubrick has trapped us in his cinematic maze to search without hope of ever discovering an adequate answer outside of our own making.",The Shining

Rob Aldam,"It works wonderfully, but The Great Dictator will perhaps be remembered most fondly for Chaplin’s moving closing speech.",The Great Dictator
Dilys Powell,For me the film contained one major error: the final speech... This finale is so blatantly out of harmony with what has gone before as to nullify much of the effectiveness of the preceding two hours.,The Great Dictator

Danielle Solzman,...Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's best film.,Inglourious Basterds
Siddhant Adlakha,"Tarantino's Western-inspired fantasy acts as a real-world corrective of how the Nazis perhaps ought to be seen - with utmost scorn - and in what context this sort of cinematic violence can, and even should, be indulgent.",Inglourious Basterds
PJ Nabarro,"It's clever, riotously amusing in parts, and does have some salient points to make about the relativity of the acceptance of violence.",Inglourious Basterds

Patrick Cavanaugh,"Capping off such a successful series is a near-impossible task, with Nolan's circumvention of expectations being wholly effective, even with its minor setbacks in narrative absurdities.",The Dark Knight Rises
Griffin Schiller,The Dark Knight Rises presents itself as a deeply fascinating examination of Batman because it’s an examination and deconstruction of the previous two entries. A lot of the ideas present in The Dark Knight are deliberately flipped on their head here.,The Dark Knight Rises
Cory Woodroof,"While this film had the impossible task of falling after the one-two mega-punch of The Dark Knight and Inception, Nolan capped his Batman trilogy with aplomb.",The Dark Knight Rises

Keith Garlington,It’s a text book lesson on the melding of big budget flamboyance with smart and challenging storytelling.,The Dark Knight Rises

Bill Gallo,"This seriocomic autopsy of middle-class virtue has the capacity to startle and surprise, and a gift for finding grim humor at the heart of tragedy.",American Beauty

Scott Nash,"Kevin Spacey is the greatest actor of his generation, hands down, no contest.",American Beauty

Anushka Halve,"The messy, imperfect and chaotic nature of the action belies the precise choreography and consideration behind it.",Oldboy
Armond White,"Oldboy is flashy, but there’s a moral and social disconnect between showing off Park’s undeniable chops and Choi Min-sik’s wild-haired, wild-eyed, poignant descent into madness.",Oldboy
David Sims,"There’s a core element of emotional realism that accentuates Park’s brutal narrative beats, leaving us to ponder something more than a bloody body.",Oldboy
David Lynch,"It’s hard to think of any movie that's come out since (outside Park’s own oeuvre, at least) that so directly challenges audience’s expectations about revenge stories, and the value we expect them to carry.",Oldboy

Niall Browne,"When it was first released back in 2003 Park Chan-wook's Oldboy hit audiences like a hammer. Forget Spike Lee's 2013 US remake with Josh Brolin, this South Korean film is the only version of Oldboy that needs to be seen.",Oldboy

Lou Lumenick,"Mozart's subtle, timeless melodies are what sustains Amadeus over its dramatic rough spots, though Shaffer and Forman do manage to end things on a grace note.",Amadeus
Eva Hoffman,"The film makes too many claims to verisimilitude to allow for suspension of disbelief... But the excitement of absorption in what remains a riveting dramatic story, in the vitality of the images, are almost enough to override all the objections.",Amadeus
Gene Siskel,The subject of artistic creation is typically handled badly in the movies... [Amadeus] treats the subject of creativity in a fresh way.,Amadeus
Roger Ebert,"This is Mozart as an eighteenth-century Bruce Springsteen, and yet (here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach.",Amadeus

Marsha McCreadie,"What has happened in the long-awaited, much-acclaimed Miloš Forman film, with its script by Shaffer, is that the popularization has gone so broad and so far afield of its elevated subject as to make that subject seem ridiculous.",Amadeus
Scott Cain,"Peter Shaffer's Amadeus is scrumptiously beautiful, sizzlingly alive and bristling with social comedy. His screenplay contains the most piercing account of deadly envy since Othello, and is a heartbreaking account of a good man's fall from grace.",Amadeus
Bob Thomas,Amadeus on the Broadway stage was a dazzling feat of dramaturgy. Miloš Forman has fashioned it into a stunning motion picture.,Amadeus
Patrick Taggart,"Forman is greatly indebted to an excellent cast, especially to Tom Hulce as the hee-hawing Mozart and Jeffrey Jones' quietly hilarious portrayal of the emperor. My own personal Oscar, though, goes to F. Murray Abraham's Salieri.",Amadeus
Stephen Hunter,"It's a film that increases in suspense and tension as it progresses; but more importantly, it ripens in the imagination afterwards, which is exactly where so many films disintegrate. Music, in Amadeus, isn't the food of love but the food of thought.",Amadeus
Jay Carr,"The filmed Amadeus, despite Mozart on the soundtrack and the visual glories of Prague, is a shambles in terms of style and form.",Amadeus
Scott Rosenberg,"Forman's film is an improvement on Shaffer's play, but wherever Amadeus turns up, in whatever medium, it's a poor excuse for art.",Amadeus

Nathan Mattise,The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular...End Game over the original Guardians by a hair...,Avengers: Endgame
Robin Holabird,This goes beyond the usual scale.,Avengers: Endgame

Olly Richards,There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.,Avengers: Endgame
Luiz Oliveira,"So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly...",Avengers: Endgame
Denise Pieniazek,"The environment and its atmosphere are a central aspect narratively, that is why Joker begins with a description of that city which, like New York from Taxi Driver, is represented as a putrid place with social violence and rising class resentment.",Joker
Anya Stanley,"Joker is what so many controversial films turn out to be: it’s fine — neither masterpiece nor trash fire, well-executed in some parts and poorly thought out in others.",Joker
Lawrence Ware,What the film wants to say — about mental illness or class divisions in society — is not as interesting as what it accidentally says about whiteness.,Joker
Serena Seghedoni,a clever gem of a movie that approaches its complex themes with extreme simplicity.,Joker
Noah Berlatsky,The joke in both cases is that the director both gets to disavow white male murderousness and claim credit for it.,Joker
Manuel São Bento,It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!,Joker
Paul Kanieski,"""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?"" That’s the question asked by the titular character of Joker, a film that luxuriates in giving us the answer.",Joker
Amy Thomasson,Joker becomes the first movie based on comic books that I actually enjoy.,Joker
Matt Brunson,"The theatrical trailer for Joker -- tight, controlled, and intriguing -- suggested the best movie Martin Scorsese never made. The actual movie is a shallow and sophomoric effort that isn't about a raging bull as much as it's merely raging bulls***.",Joker
Jonathan Garcia,"What makes this world so successful is the message. ... Negativity, like the trash, builds up over time when people are too stubborn to see the other perspective and compromise. There's a social divide in Gotham City that feels very real.",Joker
Wesley Lovell,"In the simply titled Joker, we get yet another version and this one is probably the most toxic of them all and not in a satisfying way.",Joker
Keith Garlington,"As “Joker” slow-walks us towards its eventual maelstrom of iniquity, it never spells out how we should feel about its titular character.",Joker
M.N. Miller,"Joker is violent, raw, and hits closer to home than many are willing to admit.",Joker
Cris Kennedy,"Phoenix's preparation for and commitment to this role honours Ledger and his other predecessors, with an exhausted physicality, contortionist and Gollum-gaunt.",Joker
Alachia Queen,The Joker is a powerful idea about accountability in our society but it's clear the script wasn't there. Luckily they were able to make it work with improv and interpretive dance.,Joker
Brian Eggert,"It's less a genuinely transgressive approach than one closely modeled on the work of Martin Scorsese, and thus more an exercise in homage than rebellion. Even so, that won't stop people from aggrandizing it.",Joker
David Gonzalez,"Every decade has that one transcendent film that, as time progresses, ultimately becomes a classic for cinephiles. As the 2010s decade comes to a close, the one film that will undoubtedly age like a fine wine is Todd Phillips masterpiece, Joker.",Joker
Kay-B,"As committed as I was to Phoenixs performance, I found myself walking out of the theater wondering, why did we need to tell this deeply violent and triggering story now? Where does DC go from here and this standalone film?",Joker
Nicholas Oon,"If cinema's job is to make us feel, to make us reflect upon how we've been living life, and to acknowledge some of its own brand of crazy, then I think Joker did a damn good job.",Joker

Christopher Lloyd,"Hayao Miyazaki's dark world of magic, in which humans and forest gods vie for supremacy, stands alongside the real one, commenting upon its shortcomings.",Princess Mononoke
Raffy Ermac,'Princess Mononoke' gives empowered voices to women (in a time where they didn't have any) & doesn't make them victims in need of a savior. It also forces audiences to look inward and question the way we consume things from the world around us.,Princess Mononoke
Panos Kotzathanasis,"In a style similar to ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" but much richer in context, Hayao Miyazaki manages to present a number of different comments, mostly having to do with the dark side of human nature",Princess Mononoke
Sarah Gorr,"[Miyazaki understands] the myriad complications of being a person in this world, a world with too many layers for a word like 'evil' to suffice, and Princess Mononoke reflects that.",Princess Mononoke
Matt Brunson,This is a visual treat featuring some truly unique creatures -- just check out those oddities that look like an unholy cross between Casper the Friendly Ghost and that chattering demon from the Hellraiser flicks.,Princess Mononoke

Felix Vasquez Jr.,It's one of Ghibli and Miyazaki's many animated masterpieces.,Princess Mononoke
Christopher Runyon,"Princess Mononoke's greatest feat is in crafting a story that could've been so easily simple, but manages to be more morally complex than even the most epic live-action films.",Princess Mononoke
David Denby,"This handsome, beautifully designed Japanese animated film has the size -- though not the clarity -- of a great Japanese film epic.",Princess Mononoke
Stephen Hunter,"Miyazaki's hordes of animators haven't penetrated beyond the skin; the moving creatures feel inarticulate and jerky, almost weightless, particularly when played against painterly background mattes.",Princess Mononoke

Danielle Solzman,Good Will Hunting may follow a formulaic arc but Gus Vant Sant's direction and Robin Williams and Matt Damon's performances elevate the film.,Good Will Hunting
James Croot,"Awash with emotion, but never descends in to the mawkish sentimentality that blights so many “kid with a problem” movies.",Good Will Hunting
Wesley Lovell,Good Will Hunting is a grand coup from first-time writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Their exploration of the life of a Genius trying to function as a normal person is quite amiable and full of great acting.,Good Will Hunting
Bill Boisvert,"The problem becomes more glaring when movies portray geniuses, characters who not only think constantly but think thoughts that are incomprehensible to the rest of us.",Good Will Hunting
Mark Jackson,"It's writer-stars Matt Damon & Ben Affleck's childhood friendship-chemistry and the hilarious bickering between the real-life Affleck brothers that generates the magic in ""Good Will Hunting."" Not to mention a magical performance by Robin Williams.",Good Will Hunting

Richard Propes,The film offers Robin Williams the chance to show his dramatic acting skills.,Good Will Hunting

David Baron,"The movie... [is] surprisingly moving, though resolutely unsentimental, rites-of-passage yarn.",Good Will Hunting
PJ Nabarro,"It's a deceptively good performance by Williams: the schmaltzy raw materials of Maguire would seem to be a trap, but he plays it absolutely straight, in muted, dignified tones",Good Will Hunting
Mike Clark,"The headline story from this slice of honestly earned sentiment is Matt Damon, who delivers the year's No. 1 breakthrough performance directly atop his agreeable high-profile turn in John Grisham's The Rainmaker.",Good Will Hunting
Jason Bailey,"It's a movie that captures (in a way that perhaps an older screenwriter could not convey) the limitless possibilities of youth, a movie in which a character can tell another, without cynicism, ""You could do anything you want. You are bound by nothing.""",Good Will Hunting

Jeffrey M. Anderson,"Complex gangster epic has strong violence, sex.",Once Upon a Time in America

Lou Lumenick,Adding 22 minutes only enhances Leone's brilliant saga of guilt and betrayal,Once Upon a Time in America

Howard Waldstein,"In any other director's hands, High and Low would be a crime-of-the-week story. Instead, elevated by Akira Kurosawa's masterful compositions, methodical pacing, and one of the best uses of color in film, it's a masterpiece.",High and Low

Jay Carr,"There's passion and exuberance in Klimov's work, but the essential crudity of his sensibility undermines it. At times, especially when the camera angles veer into grotesquerie, it suggests a Soviet Ken Russell movie.",Come and See
Terry Orme,"An overwhelming statement on the horrors of war, Come and See takes an unusual tack in relating a story of World War II. This is a psychological drama -- a harrowing, grueling journey into a young boy's mind as he tries to survive a very real nightmare.",Come and See
Alexander Walker,"It has a raw, primitive force that makes you realize how much of our own horror of the last war has been diminished by Hollywood heroics or simply box-office co-existence with the enemy.",Come and See
Steve Warren,"These hysterical histrionics would put me off in any circumstances, but especially when emphasizing horror that speaks for itself.",Come and See
Dave Kehr,"The film is a sustained act of looking, with a minimum of dramatic or character development, and these are sights that leave an indelible impression as strong or stronger than any antiwar film in memory.",Come and See
Jim Schembri,"Come and See is a stirring, unremittingly powerful war drama that has the rare double virtue of constantly engaging both the eye and the emotions.",Come and See
Michael Heaton,"142 minutes of lushly photographed Nazi obscenities. While the movie is technically excellent, and the director's point is well made, Come and See takes way too long a look.",Come and See
Robert Daniels,"By telling the story from a child’s perspective, Klimov gives the horrors of war a new kind of immediacy. Not one born from stern men turned tragically hollow, but from a pure spirit prematurely drained of their innocence.",Come and See
Michael Sragow,"Klimov’s dramatic vitality, his control of shifting tones, and his mastery of surprise are what galvanize Come and See. Terrifying as this movie is, we always want to know what happens next.",Come and See

James Wegg,What do you want from theory alone?,Oppenheimer

Dennis Harvey,"A splashy adventure...a precursor for the kind of jet-setting, debonair intrigue that would become ubiquitous...",North by Northwest
Wendy Ide,The plotting is tightly wound and the thrills are executed with devilish panache.,North by Northwest
Keith Garlington,"It’s lighter, flashier, and more stylish than some of Hitch’s other classics, but those are the things that make it a unique but fitting part of Hitchcock’s wonderful filmography.",North by Northwest
Dilys Powell,"It is consistently entertaining, its excitement pointed by but never interrupted by the jokes... But it is on Mr. Grant's own performance, intent, resourceful, witty, as always beautifully timed, that a large part of the pleasure depends.",North by Northwest
Pauline Kael,"Though not as cleverly original as Strangers on a Train, or as cleverly sexy as Notorious, this is one of Hitchcock’s most entertaining American thrillers.",North by Northwest
Brian Eggert,"North by Northwest distills Alfred Hitchcock's obsessions, techniques, and themes into a singular, deliriously entertaining form.",North by Northwest
Barbara L. Wilson,"Alfred Hitchcock's new thriller, North by Northwest, is one of those no holds barred films. For better than two hours, he lets the Technicolor melodrama ramble across the VistaVision screen while gleefully setting traps for his hero.",North by Northwest
Helen Bower,"On all counts, North by Northwest is Hitchcock's best picture in recent years.",North by Northwest
Marie Stevenson,[North by Northwest] gives Grant full play in the sort of role he does best -- and has the added virtue of being done by the master of suspense.,North by Northwest
Florence Epstein,"This is a classic thriller, slick as ice and about as exciting as you can stand.",North by Northwest
Hortense Morton (Screen Scout),"Relax and enjoy it -- North by Northwest is elegant, in color escape entertainment.",North by Northwest
Kate Cameron,The brilliant director has outdone himself by piling thrill on thrill for the delectation of an enraptured audience.,North by Northwest
C.A. Lejeune,"You get a lot of entertainment for your money. You get a couple of clever, sophisticated screen actors and an elegant actress with a fine-drawn, exciting face. You get one scene that will be talked about as long as people talk about films at all.",North by Northwest
Jay Carmody,"The acting in North by Northwest has that brilliant, cool surface that represents the perfect polish for the best of Hitchcock. Grant, to be sure, is the director's Number 1 hand at this sort of thing. Mason, nevertheless, comes close to matching him.",North by Northwest
Harold V. Cohen,"Very little of it makes sense, but no matter. From the moment Mr. Cary Grant, a Madison Avenue advertising man, is kidnaped by a band of foreign agents who think he's someone else, North By Northwest stays on a rollercoaster that operates on laughing gas.",North by Northwest
John L. Scott,"Grant's technique, so well established, shines brightly under Hitchcock's guidance. The two seem completely en rapport in movie making. Miss Saint, effective in her former sweet or drab roles, makes the switch to glamour as a lovely Mata Hari type.",North by Northwest
James D. Ivers,"As unmistakably Hitchcock as the famed pencil profile, this sparkling production is crammed to the edges of the Vista Vision widescreen with the trademarks of the Old Master.",North by Northwest
P.S. Harrison,Alfred Hitchcock lives up to his famed reputation as a master of suspense and thrills in this highly entertaining spy melodrama.,North by Northwest
Shadow Stage,"Can a movie be fast, funny and frightening at the same time? Ordinarily, no, but this time there's a Hitch: Hitchcock -- who's been at it for over thirty years and getting better all the time.",North by Northwest
Wendy Ide,Genuinely innovative film-making.,Citizen Kane
Noah Gittell,Kane innovated several filmmaking techniques. The film pioneered a genre.,Citizen Kane

Brian Susbielles,...the ultimate Welles film...,Citizen Kane

T.C. Kemp,"Orson Welles, who plays Kane, produces and directs, has driven to the heart of his subject with a fierce, thrusting energy that is rare and refreshing.",Citizen Kane
Reg Whitley,A distinctly out-of-the-rut production and a great piece of cinema artistry.,Citizen Kane
Brian Eggert,"Perhaps the film's most resonant quality is that, through the film's story and production, Welles inspires the same investigative process about himself and his picture.",Citizen Kane
Michael Clark,"""Citizen Kane"" forever changed the way movies were made and interpreted. It's still relevant and unique 80 years after its release. Is it the greatest movie ever? Maybe, maybe not. The most influential? Without a doubt, yes.",Citizen Kane
Michael J. Casey,"I can't think of an American-made film that stands up to multiple viewings quite like 'Kane'...it never feels like Welles and company are showing off, just showing what a movie can do.",Citizen Kane
Josephine O'Neill,Welles is the most exciting thing that's happened since sound.,Citizen Kane
Sarah Brinks,"I particularly like the structure of the film, especially the use of the news reel footage and the newspaper headlines to move the plot forward.",Citizen Kane
Ida Belle Hicks,We aren't going to quibble about the genius business. Time will take care of that and if Welles goes down in history as one well be happy to have been among those who enjoyed the results of his great talent.,Citizen Kane
Marjory Adams,The sheer brilliance and audacity of Citizen Kane... make the film the most astounding cinematic achievement of the season. It ranks with Disney's Fantasia as a milestone in motion picture technique.,Citizen Kane
Guardian Staff,Ordinary standards will not serve for Citizen Kane; extravagance of idea for serious ends is not common enough in the cinema to provide a yardstick.,Citizen Kane
Herbert Cohn,"Citizen Kane Is a triumph not only for Orson Welles, but for his entire company as well.",Citizen Kane
Frank Morriss,"Everything that Welles has to say in his capacity of author, actor and director is individual and striking. The grouping of the characters, the odd camera angles, the revealing little character glimpses are all superb.",Citizen Kane
Rohan Naahar,"Before he was surfing the sand dunes of Arakkis, Denis Villeneuve was telling a more searing story about overzealous characters waging a holy war in the desert.",Incendies

Fico Cangiano,"Denis Villeneuve's family drama goes to unexpected places that for better or for worse, stay with you for quite some time. Rewarding for those who stay the course. [Full review in Spanish]",Incendies
Kelly Jane Torrance,"Incendies is a gripping film, mostly because of the fearless performance of Belgian-born, half Moroccan, half Spanish actress [Lubna] Azabal.",Incendies
Leigh Paatsch,"Dominated by periods of eerie calm followed by sudden, astonishing mood swings, Incendies is intelligent, emotionally complex world cinema at its finest.",Incendies
Martin Tsai,"Although ""Incendies"" shows very little violence, the burden of knowing what's taking place off-screen is just as difficult for the audience to stomach.",Incendies
Roger Moore,"Rewarding, but ridiculously stingy in handing out simple details -- relationships, geographical settings, etc. -- vital to our grasp of what's going on.",Incendies
Sarah Boslaugh,"Watching Incendies is a long, hard, and emotionally draining experience but one that richly rewards the time and effort invested.",Incendies
Matt Glasby,"Every time the film begins to feel more like a history lesson than a drama, it explodes into action.",Incendies
Rob Thomas,"It's a raw and brutal look at the unending strife in the region, but it's also an unforgettable mystery that keeps the audience riveted through one surprising plot turn after another.",Incendies
Philip Martin,"...an intense and shattering experience, a nearly great film about promises and kinship and the secret, cruel lives our parents lived before we knew them",Incendies
Mike Scott,"A story of hope amid the ruins -- one that everybody can appreciate, no matter their politics.",Incendies
Victoria Alexander,Enthralling and very disturbing.,Incendies
Joanne Laurier,"How aware is Villeneuve that his hard work, with all its gems, lets Israel and the United States in particular off the hook?",Incendies
Sophie Ivan,"A beautifully filmed and movingly performed drama which explores how personal motives breed political radicalism, Incendies is occasionally - but not fatally - stymied by its clever-clever narrative contrivance.",Incendies
Roger Clarke,Incendies acquires its heft from some very deep places -- Greek tragedy rather than newsflashes.,Incendies
Jason Solomons,"Incendies is muscular, emotional film-making of the highest order, self-confident in its delivery yet always respectful of its characters' plight.",Incendies
Adam Kempenaar,Once it switches over to us getting inside her head... I started seeing it more as Judy's story than Scottie's.,Vertigo
Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"It's a product of its time (especially when it comes to the treatment of the female characters), and it's not trying to be just a thriller. Rather, it is a story about a doomed romance that turns into a dangerous obsession. Full review in Spanish.",Vertigo
Zita Short,Novak feels like she was left out to dry by Hitchcock as he spent far more time paying attention to the location of the brooch on her lapel than he spent instructing her on how to convey her character’s emotions.,Vertigo
Wesley Lovell,Vertigo is a film with numerous layers that can be discussed in depth and at length. That’s not to say it isn’t also an enjoyable film. Hitchcock knew how to make them. That’s why his films are generally beloved by critics and audiences alike.,Vertigo
Olly Richards,It is a story of obsession and control...,Vertigo
Dennis Harvey,"Those eccentricities have since become accepted, defended, and loved...",Vertigo
Dilys Powell,"The plot is a brilliant box of devilish tricks. And yet the film disappoints. It seems too long, too elaborately designed; the narration of this kind of criminal intrigue sags under such luscious treatment; it needs the touch of the harsh and the squalid.",Vertigo
Jack Moffitt,"Alfred Hitchcock tops his own fabulous record for suspense with Vertigo, a super-tale of murder, madness and mysticism that stars James Stewart and Kim Novak.",Vertigo
P.S. Harrison,"This latest Alfred Hitchcock ""thrillorama"" offers further evidence of his mastery in mystery and suspense, for, despite its flaws, it grips one's attention from start to finish.",Vertigo
Brian Eggert,A motion picture of incomparable dramatic involvement and hypnotic filmmaking.,Vertigo
Kevin Carr,"It's probably the most impeccably put together Hitchcock movie... but ultimately it's men trying to control women, and that doesn't ring very well right now.",Vertigo
Sarah Brinks,"Jimmy Stewart is an actor who always delivers, especially in the films he did with Hitchcock. Scottie isn't my favorite character he played but it really is a wonderful performance.",Vertigo
Scott Nye,"Hitchcock is often spoken about regarding his ""perfectionism,"" this way every shot is carefully arranged and the edits hit like a knife. That's no less true here...",Vertigo
Mike Massie,"One of Hitchcock's finest achievements, layering drama, a love story, adventure, and hair-raising suspense into a psychological murder-mystery that simply has no peers.",Vertigo
Allen Almachar,"If the cinema was [Hitchcock's] church, this film was his confession.",Vertigo
Joanne Laurier,"[Its] meticulous realism both indicts and empathizes with Scottie's squeezed, linear policeman mentality at odds with other, more profound longings, which depend, in the final analysis, on a radical change in social circumstances.",Vertigo
Matt Neal,"God, this is such a weird film.",Vertigo
Deborah Ross,The storytelling isn't up to much. It drags and drags.,Vertigo
Jacoba Atlas,Hitchcock's finest film.,Vertigo
Clyde Gilmour,"Even such a master-craftsman as director Alfred Hitchcock sometimes forgets that more than enough is too much, as he proves in this photogenic San Francisco suspense-mystery, which is still badly in need of the cutter's shears.",Vertigo
Wendy Ide,Arguably one of the greatest works of film noir...,Double Indemnity
David Harris,Wilder explores the seamy underside of the American Dream in many of his films but never addresses it head on like he does in Double Indemnity.,Double Indemnity
Brian Susbielles,Billy Wilder’s sensational noir...,Double Indemnity
Zita Short,I can only imagine how inadequate other actresses playing femme fatales feel when they have to live up to Stanwyck’s legend.,Double Indemnity
Dennis Harvey,The all-time vintage noir jewel...,Double Indemnity
Joe Lipsett,"It’s not just writing and direction that ultimately cement the film’s status as a classic text, though; it’s the performance by Stanwyck as the sexy, manipulative, cold-blooded femme fatale.",Double Indemnity
Wesley Lovell,"“Double Indemnity” is a largely uneven film that works in the end. Anyone looking for film noir can look no further, but if you’re looking for tons of suspense, check out Wilder’s other mystery classic.",Double Indemnity
Josh Larsen,...it’s a thrill to watch Stanwyck go to work and assert her dominance.,Double Indemnity
Cinelandia Staff,"A topic that rather resemble something from France or Russia, not Hollywood.  [Full review in Spanish]",Double Indemnity
Dilys Powell,"Double Indemnity, indeed, turned out to be a pretty good job. Good first of all because the story is told with much sureness and control.",Double Indemnity
Ian Thomas Malone,"The murder isn’t the result of a battle between good and evil, but rather a natural response to a system that had no place for either Phyllis or Neff, both pawns in someone else’s game. Capitalism is the true villain of Double Indemnity.",Double Indemnity
Sean Axmaker,It made Stanwyck the queen bee of film noir and Phyllis Dietrichson is her definitive incarnation: a platinum blonde with a heart of brass and a tarnished soul.,Double Indemnity
Jeffrey M. Anderson,"Billy Wilder's first great movie. It's quite unlike anything else the director ever made, a hard, smooth, crime film full of cynicism and lust and constantly alive and tingling.",Double Indemnity
Chuck Bowen,Double Indemnity is a ruthless and poignant cornucopia of the details that command our lives.,Double Indemnity
Rob Aldam,There’s so much to admire here and so much technical craft on display.,Double Indemnity
T.C. Kemp,"It does not engage the emotions, mercifully. Rather it invites the laying of odds as to whether the guilty parties will “get away with it.”",Double Indemnity
Reg Whitley,"An ingenious, cleverly written and well acted melodrama, which teems with suspense and thrills.",Double Indemnity
Mary Hunt,Barbara Stanwyck Is consistently tough throughout and gives an excellent performance.,Double Indemnity
Roy Stuart,"Double Indemnity is positively the best murder film I’ve ever, ever seen. And it’s good old straight old, villainous murder without any psychological alleyways to get lost in.",Double Indemnity
Brian Eggert,"A cynical and shrewd motion picture, full of wit and acid.",Double Indemnity
Steve Warren,"Though almost as long, Scarface doesn't have the depth or complexity of either Godfather films. It is, however, a hard-hitting update of the old-style gangster movie.",Scarface
John Stark,"What could have been a somber, depressing story has been kept buoyantly afloat by De Palma's wry, sarcastic look at grown men who wear expensive suits and shoot each other.",Scarface
Tom Sabulis,"Scarface clearly lacks the suspense, macabre style and the deranged wit of previous De Palma films such as Carrie and Dressed to Kill. It is too slow for an action movie and too bent on destruction to make it for serious moviegoers.",Scarface
Marylynn Uricchio,"Working from Oliver Stone's script, De Palma shapes a chilling, unpleasant but perversely entertaining portrait of the cocaine business. To his credit, its 2 hours and 45 minutes fly by like so many bullets.",Scarface
Joe Baltake,"Scarface is vile, sordid, dispiriting and degrading for all involved. It's major flaws, however, are its overall dullness and disorganization.",Scarface
Stephen Hunter,"For a time, it seems to be on the way toward greatness, but then -- perhaps reflecting the descent of its protagonist -- it tumbles into mediocrity.",Scarface
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"There's too much expertise, too much sheer love of movie-making up there on the screen for Scarface to be deemed a failure. But the director's failure to follow through makes this a too-long movie that comes up short.",Scarface
Eddie Harrison,…packs the punch of a grenade-launcher…,Scarface
Sean Axmaker,"De Palma directs it as a blood-drenched thug opera, a mix of the graceful and the garish with Pacinos guttural thug-in-a-suit spitting out dialogue like broken glass in a harsh Cuban accent.",Scarface
Mike Massie,"It will primarily be remembered as a machine-gun-soaked actioner of tough talk, cinematic betrayals and retribution, and mountains of cocaine.",Scarface
Tom Meek,"Day-Glo Miami is framed well by John A. Alonzo, and the pulsating music by Giorgio Moroder is worthy of a listen on its own.",Scarface
Allison Rose,Pacino is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a Cuban immigrant in Scarface is a perfect example of his work.,Scarface
Duane Byrge,"Other than an unflinching, intense and extraordinary performance from Al Pacino as the Cuban-born gangster Tony Montana, this gruesome offering has little to recommend.",Scarface
Kathleen Carroll,"Stone sticks all too closely to the dated plot structure of the original movie, and such melodramatic flourishes as Montana's incestuous attraction for his sister now seem completely ludicrous.",Scarface
Richard Corliss,"It is a serious, often hilarious peek under the rock where nightmares strut in $800 suits and Armageddon lies around the next twist of treason.",Scarface
Alan Jones,"The sharp, if expletive-ridden, dialogue in Oliver Stone's script and the vivid cinematography of John A Alonzo help make De Palma's urban shocker a modern-day classic.",Scarface
Unknown reviewer,Characterization and plot go out the window. Arms are cut off with chain saws. By the third hour everything is out of control.,Scarface
David Sterritt,[Brian DePalma] apparently considers ''money isn't everything'' an original and profound message.,Scarface
Nick Rogers,"One fundamentally dishonest character choice launched a billion-dollar industry. But it hardly sours a film that became a garishly ghoulish, bleakly funny and compulsively watchable template for modern-criminal deconstructions of the American Dream.",Scarface
Rob Vaux,"By ignoring its massive, toxic, nuclear-fallout shortcomings, it finds its way to the hallowed status of camp classic.",Scarface
Pauline Kael,"What happened to the Kubrick who used to slip in sly, subtle jokes and little editing tricks? This may be his worst movie.",Full Metal Jacket
Jay Scott,"Full Metal Jacket is violent, caustic, ironic, and cold, an amoral object formed from a camera gliding majestically across slow-motion carnage while refusing to blink an eye or shed a tear.",Full Metal Jacket
Peter Rainer,"Kubrick is trying to make a movie about madness and chaos, but he won't give in to the chaos.",Full Metal Jacket
Henry Sheehan,The most horrifying moments of Full Metal Jacket are those in which the young Americans gladly assist in their own damnation.,Full Metal Jacket
Andrew Pollard,"A hard-hitting movie laced with moments of dark humour and brimming with social commentary, Full Metal Jacket is viewed as one of the all-time great war movie.",Full Metal Jacket
Allison Rose,Kubrick had a way of making the audience become invested in the characters of his films and created some truly memorable ones.,Full Metal Jacket
Richard Propes,It was a gross injustice that Ermey was not nominated for his tremendous performance.,Full Metal Jacket
Mike Massie,"A nicely contrasting soundtrack, intense action sequences, mesmerizing sets, excellent photography, and believable characters contribute to this poignant thriller.",Full Metal Jacket
Ed Travis,Full Metal Jacket is a master study in indoctrination and fundamental identity shifts. Every moment of the film builds and builds on Kubrick's ideas...,Full Metal Jacket
Hilary Mantel,"We look to the director for some judgment, or even an indication of his opinion, as to whether his carnage artists are born or made; but we don't get it.",Full Metal Jacket
Jack Garner,"An electrifying opening segment that could stand alone as one of Kubrick's great films, except it's only about 45 minutes long.",Full Metal Jacket
Stanley Kauffmann,Full Metal Jacket seems further proof that Kubrick is still trapped in self-pleasing cinematic exercise.,Full Metal Jacket
Cathy Burke,"Full Metal Jacket, produced, directed and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, is not an easy film to watch, but from the first frame to the last, it is a riveting one.",Full Metal Jacket
John Rico,"One of the classics of war cinema, it's not nearly as good as its legend suggests. But it's pretty good.",Full Metal Jacket
Peter Travers,"[Kubrick's] genius, and perhaps burden, is to see the insanity in us all and to make it seem so terrifyingly normal.",Full Metal Jacket
David Nusair,...a justifiably iconic war film.,Full Metal Jacket
Tim Brayton,"One of Kubrick's foremost triumphs, a genuinely challenging and uncomfortable war film",Full Metal Jacket
Terrence Rafferty,"No amount of stylistic analysis, however, is likely to explain why a man would devote more than three years of his life to making a war movie in which violent death isn't meant to move us. Does Kubrick really think we're not callous enough about war?",Full Metal Jacket
Adrian Turner,While its message is simple -- innocent young Americans are taught to be machine-like killers -- its technique is extraordinary.,Full Metal Jacket
Ben Yagoda,"If a film doesn't give us people, it has to offer a substitute -- an idea, a style, a vision. Full Metal Jacket comes up blank.",Full Metal Jacket
Geoff Brown,"Stripped to its bones, Heat may sound trite. But Mann puts so much flesh on his characters that you never feel hungry.",Heat
Jonathan Romney,"Like Kubrick, Mann takes a genre premise that seems like no big deal, and expands it into a cosmos of its own. Heat might simply be the most spectacular B-movie ever made, but that’s impressive enough.",Heat
Rick Groen,"Dream match-ups on paper don't always succeed on the screen -- like twin fires fighting for oxygen, will they merely cancel each other out? Hardly. This is one titanic clash that actually lives up to the billing.",Heat
Roger Ebert,"Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, poetic when necessary. They're not trapped with clichés.",Heat
Mike Davies,"Heat is a giant of a film, a god among American crime thrillers… Masterpiece is an overused term. Here it barely comes close.",Heat
Tom Long,"Mann has produced the best crime epic since Goodfellas and one of the best films of the year, an absolute must-see for anyone who likes good (heck, great) acting and modern cinema.",Heat
Manohla Dargis,"At its core it's actually about virtuosity... and, by extension, the virtuosity of Mann himself, of which there's no short supply. Too bad it's running on empty; if the film weren't so hollow it would be a masterpiece.",Heat
Harper Barnes,"Time and again, Heat veers sharply out of the groove worn by a thousand other movies. As I said, it's not an ordinary movie -- indeed, it's an extraordinary one, with compelling performances, a fascinating mix of characters and a riveting story line.",Heat
John Wrathall,"There's not a boring building in the film. Mann is the best director of architecture since Antonioni. In fact, few film-makers at work today can rival Mann's control of every detail of the film-making process.",Heat
Rene Jordan,A film with so many possibilities that it ends up as split cake between Bob and Val. [Full review in Spanish],Heat
William Arnold,"Both stars have their share of dynamic moments, and, gosh knows, there's plenty of explosive action. But it's a long sit, and by the time the excruciatingly drawn-out climax comes to its end, you're more than ready to head for the exits.",Heat
Jay Carr,"Flaws notwithstanding, you've got to salute the size and richness and technical dazzle that sustain Mann's impressive vision.",Heat
Peter Keough,"The Martin Scorsese film we've been looking forward to this year is by Michael Mann. Had it been about half an hour and three or four subplots shorter it might have been on the level of Goodfellas. As it is, it's as long as Casino but far more engrossing.",Heat
Rene Rodriguez,"Heat is icier than it is fiery, though as this movie proves, ice too can burn. It’s a simple cops-and-robbers tale writ larger than life by its powerhouse cast and by writer-director Michael Mann, who refuses to play by the rules of the form.",Heat
Jack Mathews,"It is huge commercial grandstanding by all involved, and will satisfy no one hoping for a mano-a-mano acting clinic. But hey, it could have been Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.",Heat
Mark Jenkins,"Heat may be something different for Mann, but in the larger context of Hollywood it’s mostly more of the same.",Heat
Jason Margolis,It is this attention to detail and character development that enriches this film to a higher level and may also bore your typical action film fan to tears.,Heat
Steve Persall,"Pacino and De Niro don't need gunpowder to heat up a screen, just something more inspiring than Heat. Those guys should make a movie together sometime.",Heat
Terry Lawson,"Mann understands what too many directors, impressed by their credentials, do not; when Pacino and De Niro talk, the audience listens. We don't need to be browbeaten. Mann extends that respect for all of Heat.",Heat
Thelma Adams,"Occasionally, Heat rises to the level of good slush TV, but when Mann succumbs to De Niro and Pacino worship and takes himself too seriously, the results are lukewarm.",Heat
Cory Woodroof,"Pete Docter is one of the best directors in animation history for a reason, as his second film is a definitive work in the medium.",Up

Aglaia Berlutti,"Kiah Roache-Turner's ""Sting"" takes the idea of an arachnid attack to analyze several underlying themes. More effective as a dark horror comedy than a typical genre film, it is also a rare insight into deep fear and primal urges. [Full Review in Spanish]",The Sting

Josiah Teal,Sting sells itself quickly in the introduction and never lets up from the wonder of moviemaking.,The Sting
Alan French,"Making for a fun throwback to creature features of the 1950s. Focusing on a very hungry spider creates a sense of menace throughout the movie. However, some rough pacing and the reliance on CGI make Sting too uneven.",The Sting
Dennis Harvey,"The basic elements here are formulaic, but they’re handled with considerable vigor, and a sense of humor.",The Sting
Candice McMillan,"Sting makes spiders scary again, standing as its own breed in the genre ... a creepy crawly, squirm-in-your-seat ride.",The Sting
Cody Leach,Sting is a fun and effectively creepy creature feature. The alien/arachnid approach changes up the creepy crawly formula enough to feel fresh. Too many of the characters were over-the-top caricatures to be a complete home-run.,The Sting
Tyler Smith,"For some reason, the spider is never truly frightening.",The Sting
Josh Goller,"Writer-director Kiah Roache-Turner’s arachnid creature feature has elements that work, but it can’t quite weave them all together into something with the lasting power of a film like Arachnophobia.",The Sting
Thom Ernst,"Roache-Turner infuses the film with creature-feature, B-movie sensibilities, a skill Australian filmmakers have mastered and which turn out to be better than anticipated.",The Sting
Jonathan DeHaan,"Sting is a classic monster movie, jam-packed with killer moments of arachnid mayhem, a stacked-roaster of kooky characters, and brilliantly bugged-out special effects.",The Sting
Jarrod Jones,"With Sting, Kiah Roache-Turner has cobbled together his most modestly realized horror movie pastiche yet, blending Wētā Workshop creature effects with a family drama that gives some weight to its gooey kills.",The Sting
Jordy Sirkin,"A promising premise that could have been packed with lots of fun gags feasting on your arachnophobia, but unfortunately, it's a spidey tale without much bite.",The Sting
Abbie Bernstein,Never trust an alien spider.,The Sting
Kristian M. Lin,[Sting] just barely manages to inject some freshness into the killer-spider subgenre.,The Sting
Dan Murrell,"While it’s not an all-time classic, it is a fun and breezy 90-minute watch with some great gore moments, cheeky set-up and pay-off sequences, and genuinely good performances from a talented cast.",The Sting
Luke Y. Thompson,"Sting may be as predictable as any slasher movie, but delivers enough of the spider-goods to satisfy, up to and including the inevitable sequel tease.",The Sting
Angelos Koutsourakis,"Equally important is that the film avoids oversimplistic condemnations of the Iranian regime, showing that oppression can be propagated unconsciously, even by those who are at the bottom of society.",A Separation

David Walsh,A Separation provides one of the few glimpses that Americans and others in the West will have into the reality of Iranian life.,A Separation

Mattie Lucas,Farhadi discovers simple yet deeply human truths - that the divides that so often separate us can seem so impossibly wide are never quite as far as we imagine.,A Separation
PJ Nabarro,"Cleverly, A Separation doesn't conspicuously proselytise about its socio-political import; it is largely concerned with matters of the family that to some degree are universal",A Separation
Stephen Saito,"The quiet, staggering power of ""A Separation"" is in the realization that navigating the politics of government or of family are tasks of equal scale and equally treacherous.",A Separation
Kelly Jane Torrance,"Just as nuanced, but with a bigger emotional punch, is the rest of this Rashomon-like tale of right and wrong, life and death, actions and consequences, all of which reveal various particulars of life in Tehran.",A Separation
Kiko Martinez,Writer/director Asghar Farhadi delivers a complex and honest portrayal of two families in modern-day Tehran. It is a challenging and heartbreaking film that deserves an audience.,A Separation
Joseph Walsh,The complexity of the characters is wonderful; as a viewer you in one scene enraged at their actions then following a plot twist in the next scene you are wholeheartedly sympathizing with them.,A Separation

Candace Wiggins and Tia Nikolopoulas,"[It's] a rip-snorting, action-packed adventure. It is fun. It is exhilarating. It has all the elements you want -- the hero, the trustworthy friends, the villains, the father's love, the damsel, the action, the cliffhangers, the prize.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Roger Ebert,"As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Nathan Paige,"If Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were never born, the world would be a little less exciting.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Caryn James,"Of the three Jones films, The Last Crusade may well become the sentimental favorite, the Indiana to end them all.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Jeff Simon,All concerned say that this is the end of Indiana Jones the end the series that began with Raiders of the Lost Ark. I'm not buying it. This thing looks as if it was almost as much fun to make as it was arduous.,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Chris Hicks,"It's impossible to recapture the joy and wonder of seeing a superlative picture like Raiders for the first time, but to his credit Spielberg comes very close.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Jack Garner,"River Phoenix, meanwhile, has a few marvelous moments as the adolescent Indiana Jones in the film's fabulous 16-minute prologue.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Richard Schickel,"I think this last installment in the popular series, made with the same care, conviction and energy as the first, but orchestrating the elements of a delicious formula at a still higher level of sophistication, may well be the best of his best.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Ron Larsen,"Excesses notwithstanding, The Last Crusade’s debits are far outweighed by its credits. Chief among them is the film’s riveting 16-minute opening sequence, which serves as a combination prologue/prequel to the entire series.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Bruce R. Miller,"It's a shame that Spielberg and Ford say this is going to be the last Indiana Jones. There's so much life in this, the third installment, it could fuel several more.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

Rick Chatenever,"People who like action for its own sake will think this movie's great. As for people who think there should be something more than action -- that it should signify or symbolize or say something -- they'll think it's great, too.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Bob Thomas,"You could play the cynic and say it is an outrageous piece of audience manipulation. Or, you could say that it is a thrilling exercise in pure cinema. Why not the latter?",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Dennis King,verall it’s a cunning expertly made film that proves itself a lavish entertainment. Its mixture of blithe silliness and heart-racing action makes keeping up with the Jones a joyful and exhilarating experience.,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Terry Orme,The repartee between Ford and Connery provides a nice balance to Spielberg's magically choreographed action. The actors make it all look so easy and are obviously enjoying the verbal jousting.,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Terry Lawson,"One of the things that made Raiders such a delight was the way he was able to recapture the B-movie thrills of the old-time serials in A-movie style, and The Last Crusade accomplishes that as well, as its two-hours-plus speed by in a breathless rush.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Fred Lutz,"With [Last Crusade], Steven Spielberg has regained the inspired sense of humor that made Raiders of the Lost Ark such fun. He demonstrates convincingly that he has no peer among directors today when it comes to the humorous approach to action-adventure.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
Nestor Bentancor,"Nothing lasts forever... except for this cinematic party that keeps welcoming us to one of the best action and christmas movies ever. 
[Full Review in Spanish]",Die Hard
Stephanie Archer,"One of the most divisive holiday classics, the argument on whether John McTiernan's Die Hard is a Christmas movie, finds its way to the forefront every year. For myself, the truth is indisputable. Die Hard is a Christmas film - no, a Christmas classic.",Die Hard
David Hogan,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top.",Die Hard
Chase Hutchinson,"Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them.",Die Hard
Nick Schager,"That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday.",Die Hard
Brian Eggert,"The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered.",Die Hard

Tom Meek,"It's another anti-cheer holiday selection, but one that keeps on giving - rewatchable sans saturation...",Die Hard
Samuel R. Murrian,"Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels.",Die Hard
Matt Brunson,"Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you.""",Die Hard
Sarah Brinks,"Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable.",Die Hard
Mike Massie,"A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn.",Die Hard
Brian D. Johnson,"The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming.",Die Hard
Sergio Benítez,The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish],Die Hard
Peter Bradshaw,"It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen.",Die Hard

Wendy Ide,"Very cartoonish, but still quite a lark, with lots of Ritchie’s kinetic directorial style.",Snatch
Allison Rose,"As Ritchie's second feature film, Snatch is well done and shows inklings of the master craftsman he will eventually become.",Snatch
Sergio Benítez,It is unquestionable that the script and direction are of an impressive level that places the filmmaker as one of the most eloquent writers and brightest narrators that emerged from the perfidious Albión in the last two decades. [Full Review in Spanish],Snatch

David Ansen,"With this morbidly bouncy black comedy Ritchie finds a sneaky way to avoid sophomore slump: by passing his freshman tests all over again. And now for something completely different, please.",Snatch
James Plath,An entertaining romp of a crime caper flick that wants to be funny more than it wants to be dangerous or mysterious.,Snatch
M. Faust,"Eccentric characters, lively banter, adults only.",Snatch
Matthew Pejkovic,"Snatch uses and abuses the template of its breakthrough predecessor, elevates it, and delivers an equal, if not better, version of a film we have all seen before, yet much better the second time around.",Snatch
Unknown reviewer,"Of the ensemble, only Pitt truly shows his class, delivering an amusing yet emotive performance amongst a group of actors who -- at best -- are pandering to laddish culture.",Snatch
Lisa Alspector,"Ritchie may be skilled at generating controlled chaos, but his surprise-a-minute strategy ultimately holds no surprises.",Snatch
Jeffrey M. Anderson,"It's a twisting, witty, and wise crime-boxing story about the hunt for a huge diamond and a prizefighter who can't take a fall.",Snatch
Wally Hammond,"Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock is an even more craftily concocted underworld entertainment, helped no end by the casting of Pitt as the bare-knuckle boxer Mickey.",Snatch
David Nusair,"...an ideal follow-up to writer/director Guy Ritchie's debut effort, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.",Snatch

Philip Martin,"Madonna's husband is a dervish in the editing room, and he's not ashamed to have nicked most of the conventions of American noir.",Snatch
Jeffrey Westhoff,"Fortunately, the drop in entertainment value from one Ritchie film to the next isn't as steep as the drop in originality.",Snatch
Jeffrey Overstreet,It's rather like the favorite pastime of this movie's villain ... throwing wild dogs into a pit and watching them fight until there's only one left standing.,Snatch
Spence D.,"This is a swift, sharp picture that pleases the senses on all levels, ranging from the visual to the aural, the linguistic, and yes even the intellectual.",Snatch
Eugene Novikov,"There's just not a lot of fun to be had here. The plot is too convoluted, too filled with double-reversals and twists for us to turn our brains off, relax and watch Guy Ritchie's kinetic visual style.",Snatch
Ryan McQuade,All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...,Hamilton
Rosa Parra,The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.,Hamilton
David Reddish,"Perhaps because of the concert format, and because so many of the songs arent scenes in the traditional sense, the plot also becomes difficult to follow in places.",Hamilton
Victoria Luxford,"The concept is far from being a gimmick, it is a living, heart-stopping masterpiece that uses culture of the present to tell stories from the past.",Hamilton
Robin Holabird,"Hamilton warrants this extra attention because while the play talks history, it also created history with a flashy, fun approach to musical entertainment.",Hamilton
Greg Cwik,"There is an implicit experience of theater...one that makes Hamilton enjoyable to the degree that it is, and one that does not translate, here, to film.",Hamilton
Eddie Harrison,"...this neither-fish-nor-fowl version, capturing theatrics not adapted for film, isn't what we need right now...",Hamilton
Cate Young,One of the benefits of the film is how much additional visual information is added to the experience of the story. The cast album is its own entity.,Hamilton
Matt Brunson,Musical theater par excellence.,Hamilton
Mark Meszoros,"This almost goes without saying because it is so unsurprising: This cinematic representation of Hamilton is, like the work itself, absolutely terrific.",Hamilton
Kristen Maldonado,"Telling the story of America then with a diverse cast representing America now, [Hamilton] really transports you with its incredible visuals and performances.",Hamilton
Richard Crouse,"Miranda's daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn't need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.",Hamilton
Amelia Emberwing,This taping does a remarkable job showcasing the play in a new way-even if you've already seen it on stage.,Hamilton
Maureen Lee Lenker,"On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.",Hamilton
Josh Spiegel,"Historical weightiness aside, Hamilton is simply fun.",Hamilton
Eleanor Bley Griffiths,"It's fantastic to have a filmed version that gets as close to putting us ""in the room where it happens"" as it's possible to get.",Hamilton
Sean O'Connell,"The show, against all odds, lives up to its hype.",Hamilton
Ben Pearson,"This is a stage show with cameras capturing the action, and while I appreciated seeing it, I felt like there were missed opportunities to editorialize a little more and draw deeper visual connections than what the proscenium of a stage could provide.",Hamilton
Neil Smith,Do not throw away your shot at watching Hamilton's original cast both make and recreate history. 'Satisfied'? You will be.,Hamilton
Robert Roten,"This two and a half hour movie covers a lot of events that happen over a period of many years, but it manages to do all this at a very lively pace. The songs, both rap and more traditional theatrical songs are well-written and performed.",Hamilton

Keith Garlington,"The flawless ensemble..., the masterfully written story, the vibrant yet gritty vision of 1950s LA - most everything clicks in this fittingly cynical and undeniably seductive period crime thriller that still maintains its style and sizzle.",L.A. Confidential
Dan DiNicola,The best and richest crime-cop drama in decades... This is an instant classic.,L.A. Confidential
Stephen Silver,"One of the best cop films, L.A. films, and 1950s-set films. It’s also the best movie most of its cast and crew have ever been associated with. (25th anniversary)",L.A. Confidential
Quentin Falk,"Darker than piping hot coffee and more hard-boiled than a picnic egg, here's a colourfully brutal, thriller which might have been hewn from Hollywoods golden heyday.",L.A. Confidential
Ella Taylor,A masterfully smart and soulful film that bows low before genre even as it betrays it.,L.A. Confidential
Eleanor O'Sullivan,"Danny DeVito plays vile Sid for more laughs than such a sleazy type deserves, while Kim Basinger portrays a woman disappointed by life but still hopeful for salvation.",L.A. Confidential
Alison Gillmor,"The ensemble cast is flawless, anchored by two intense young Aussies, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.",L.A. Confidential

Dann Gire,"One of the toughest, freshest movies of the year.",L.A. Confidential
Jeff Simon,"All the cops are corrupt in different ways. But as the murk and muck of the story deepens and thickens, three of them rouse themselves out of their moral torpor and rediscover their vocation, if not exactly their honor.",L.A. Confidential
Jay Carr,"One of the things the film conveys, in addition to institutionalized corruption, is the energy and excitement of a city that knows it's on the move. L.A. Confidential is juicy dynamite.",L.A. Confidential
Bill Morrison,"Director Curtis Hanson, who adapted the novel with Brian Helgeland, has created a film that delivers in every way.",L.A. Confidential
Michael Dwyer,"Directed with vibrant panache by Hanson, L.A. Confidential is a terrific thriller, lean, taut and deeply involving, and rich in moral complexity.",L.A. Confidential
Dennis King,"With the relish of brazen headlines splashed across the top of a Police Gazette-type scandal sheet, L.A. Confidential peers seductively into the dark heart of the city and conjures up a grand piece of hard-boiled entertainment.",L.A. Confidential
Wallace Baine,I loved this movie and respected its just-right blend of art and entertainment. Its lack of ironic self-consciousness and its insistence that its heroes be imperfect men of imperfect justice make this an exquisite noir experience.,L.A. Confidential
David Stratton,Dante Spinotti's widescreen camerawork and Jeannine Oppewall`s production design brilliantly recreate the somewhat tawdry world of a glamorous city which is starting to lose its glamour.,L.A. Confidential
Sean P. Means,"Hollywood has always been fascinated with the seamier side of Los Angeles. The lure of movie-star glamour has always drawn the strivers, schemers, seducers and swindlers. All are in abundance in LA Confidential.",L.A. Confidential
Joel E. Siegel,What makes it so compelling is the scope and richness of its design. One leaves it with the sense of satisfaction one feels after snapping into place the last piece of a brain-teasing jigsaw puzzle.,L.A. Confidential
Michael D. Reid,Most remarkable of all is the way the film's top notch cast is in sync with the noir style without drawing attention to themselves. Australian actors Crowe and Pearce are especially good.,L.A. Confidential
Nadine Whitney,The power of 1917 lies in its ability to tell a human story of a single mission and translate that into an account that encompasses the brutality of trench warfare.,1917
Manuel São Bento,"Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Roger Deakins’ jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman’s emotionally powerful score, Sam Mendes' impeccable directing, and Lee Smith’s seamless editing.",1917
Paul Kanieski,"Without a doubt, 1917 is technically brilliant, visually stunning, and occasionally moving. If not for its lack of fully realized characters and a deeper story, it might have been a masterpiece.",1917
Peter Bell,"With a fresh, new approach, Mendes memorializes not only his grandfather, but all the brave soldiers of WWI, reminding viewers of the individual tragedies that comprise warfare.",1917
Amy Thomasson,"1917 can best be described as a mediocre war film. Yes, Deakins worked his usual magic with cinematography...McKay did an adequate job...sadly, we know very little about his character, and the film does not allow him to grow...",1917

Victor Pineyro,For experiences like the one I had in the theatre watching this is why I love film. Constantly asking myself how they did this. Probably Sam Mendes' best movie to date. [Full review in Spanish],1917
Jimmy Cage,"Unfortunately I dont see what most see in 1917. Respectively, I hardly feel anything except some respect for the technical achievements. But that alone isnt enough - it actually slightly damages the film overall.",1917
Brian Eggert,The film's formal indulgences distract from its dramatic potential.,1917
Victoria Luxford,What makes it so special is the balance between artistry and realism. Mendes reaches down into the mud and finds something beautiful.,1917
Carson Timar,1917 is a technical masterpiece that comes together with genuine powerful emotion to become a captivating work of art.,1917
Salome Gonstad,"We should be drawn into the personal story--director Sam Mendes loosely based the movie on his grandfather Alfred's wartime experiences--but instead, we're watching all the smoke and mirrors. It's sound and fury that could signify so much more.",1917
Graeme Tuckett,"What could have been a gimmick in the service of a weaker narrative becomes a masterstroke here, basically denying us any let-off from the tension of what is happening on the screen.",1917
Milana Vujkov,The gimmicky side of [its single take] fades juxtaposed to the perspective it offers.,1917
Catherine Springer,"In addition to Deakins, production designer Dennis Gassner and composer Thomas Newman also add layers of bravura artistry to create an experience that will leave you breathless, heart pounding and absolutely emotionally wrecked by the end.",1917
Robin Holabird,Mendes creates one of the best films released in 2019.,1917
Roger Moore,"It's a great film -- among the greatest, and if you want to have an informed conversation about any movie any where in the world, ""Bicycle Thieves"" is the cornerstone work of your film cinema education.",Bicycle Thieves
Cory Woodroof,"This is one of the best studies of post-World War II Italy that you will find, as it’s just a sweeping portrait of unrelenting humanity on the brink of ruin.",Bicycle Thieves
Sean Axmaker,"[Vittorio] De Sica brings an almost documentary style to capture life in front of his lens, but infused it with an eye toward poetic realism.",Bicycle Thieves
Keith Garlington,“The Bicycle Thief” paints a bleak picture of a troubling cycle. It takes abject poverty and theft and links them together to form a depressing revolving door.,Bicycle Thieves
Brian Eggert,"At its most essential, the film cries out with humanity, establishing its place of renown in the highest ranks of international cinema.",Bicycle Thieves
André Bazin,"[Bicycle Thieves] does not depend on the mathematical elements of drama, the action does not exist beforehand as if it were an ""essence."" It follows from the pre-existence of the narrative, it is the ""integral"" of reality.",Bicycle Thieves
Sarah Brinks,The story of Bicycle Thieves is simple but the film isn't simple at all. I love that at its heart it is a film about the limits of a man's morality and his relationship with his son.,Bicycle Thieves
Richard Winnington,Bicycle Thieves is a wholly satisfying film in that de Sica has so simplified and mastered the mechanics of the job that nothing stands between you and his intention.,Bicycle Thieves
Mike Massie,"Deceptively simple, Vittorio De Sica's cinematic masterpiece features unequalled, authentic performances by non-actors.",Bicycle Thieves
Merl Edelman,So immediate is the reality of its experience that the audience seldom notices the excellence of its directorial craftsmanship.,Bicycle Thieves
Robert Ellis,If there ever was a picture whose impact left one realizing that men who are tortured are the same in any country -- this is the movie.,Bicycle Thieves
Clyde Gilmour,"A poetic tragi-comedy from Italy, at times recalling the art of Chaplin at his best in its blending of laughter and tears. It was masterfully directed by Vittorio De Sica.",Bicycle Thieves
Mattie Lucas,"Sparse, melancholy, and strikingly real, Bicycle Thieves has the haggard, hangdog feel of a documentary, with a dramatic structure so subtle that its shattering climax almost comes as a blindside.",Bicycle Thieves
Bob Thomas,"This gem tells the story of a frantic search bv a man and his son for a stolen bike which provided for the family's existence. It is told with the usual Italian realism, but with unusual excitement.",Bicycle Thieves
Christy Lemire,"Decades later, you can see the influence of Bicycle Thieves everywhere, in a variety of genres and languages.",Bicycle Thieves
Matt Brunson,"It's not hyperbole to flatly state that this is one of the all-time greats in the annals of cinema; on my own list, only Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal ranks higher when it comes to foreign-language films.",Bicycle Thieves
James Kendrick,"It has passages of beauty and heartbreak that suggest a genuine humanism that is all too often lacking from movies whose primary goals are to thrill, excite, or otherwise distract from life itself.",Bicycle Thieves
Kate Muir,"Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves is tender and immediate, a simple tale of a man whose bike is stolenwhen his job and life depends upon it.",Bicycle Thieves
William Poster,"The Bicycle Thief does have a certain ramshackle simplicity, quietness, and even naivete that are not unwelcome as a change from the stunning noise, ingenuity, and sophistication of Hollywood.",Bicycle Thieves
Jonathan Rosenbaum,"The work of screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, director Vittorio De Sica, the nonprofessional actors, and many others is so charged with a common purpose that there's no point in even trying to separate their achievements.",Bicycle Thieves
Desmond Ryan,"It works its strange alchemy with riveting force… With this extraordinary film, Scorsese confirms his standing among our finest young directors. It is, among other things, a testament to the versatility that last produced Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.",Taxi Driver
Janet Maslin,"Experiencing the film on an insulated, intellectual level is a virtual impossibility, thanks to a central performance so individualized and affecting that Travis is never in danger of becoming a statistic or a symbol.",Taxi Driver
John Huddy,"The bonds are close and tight between Scorsese's first film and his most recent effort. And yet Taxi Driver stands alone. It is original, harrowing, instant American mythology.",Taxi Driver
Kevin Kelly,"Taxi Driver is so volatile it nearly explodes from the screen. Under Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction, it works a dramatic tension that is inescapable, carefully, systematically straitjacketing its audience in the problems of its central character.",Taxi Driver
Cynthia Genser,"Scorsese has spit all his disgust right in our faces. Well, you don't have to like it. But when the doors of the [theater] opened to let us out, there was New York and I knew, I knew it was no longer possible to avoid the horror.",Taxi Driver
Gene Siskel,"Remove the cataclysmic ending from Taxi Driver and it would be one smashingly good motion picture. As it stands, the film is beautiful to look at, exciting to listen to, but much too much to stomach.",Taxi Driver
Charles Champlin,"Whatever else anybody comes to think about Taxi Driver, it has a muscle-tensing, skin-prickling, apprehensive suspense that builds from those first unsettling moments like an air-raid siren.",Taxi Driver
John Simon,"All these things might be reconciled and resolved, if only the film probed deeper instead of trying merely to astonish and dazzle. Obviously, it is the offspring of an unholy union.",Taxi Driver
Frank Rich,"Like any genuine nightmare, Taxi Driver induces terror because its hideousness grows out of pure, if awful, human truth.",Taxi Driver
Jack Kroll,"Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Chapman create a funky, overripe New York that's like a nightmare Travis can never stop dreaming... But first and last Taxi Driver belongs to Robert De Niro, the most remarkable young actor of the American screen.",Taxi Driver
Stanley Kauffmann,Even if [the actors] were all better -- and part of the picture's trouble is that there is no way for them to be much better -- Taxi Driver would still be no more than the 1976 dark-mirror image of 1936 romance.,Taxi Driver
Joe Pollack,"Taxi Driver is a fascinating film. It is strong and moving, and it often affects the emotions like a blow to the stomach. It is not for the squeamish, but it is one superior piece of motion picture artistry.",Taxi Driver
Joseph Gelmis,"Whether it is a doomsday masterpiece or an exploitative ripoff of national paranoia, or both, as I believe, be forewarned that Taxi Driver has a hard R rating and is definitely not suitable for the squeamish.",Taxi Driver
Rex Reed,"Scorsese is obviously talented. He knows how to build mood, tension and atmosphere... But he's short on coherence where it matters most. His films are beginning to look like they've been made by a promising upstart who believes his own press clippings.",Taxi Driver
Stanley Eichelbaum,The director has created a highly effective profile of an incipient killer and De Niro's portrayal of the obsessively mad Travis is terrifically convincing.,Taxi Driver
Hal Crowther,"Taxi Driver is shocking and indulgent, and it's compelling. I don't think I agree with it or even approve of it, but I couldn't help admiring it.",Taxi Driver
Dean Johnson,"So sure, there are lonely people out there -- but Taxi Driver fails to offer an imitable solution to lone wolfishness. The outcome is about as senseless as the director's closeup of a glass of fizzy Alka-Seltzer.",Taxi Driver
R.H. Gardner,"Taxi Driver manages to be an engrossing film, owing to the fascinating street atmosphere created by Scorsese's dynamic camera work and the authentic performances of the entire cast. De Niro's portrayal is particularly haunting.",Taxi Driver
Andrew Sarris,"I didn't mind the sordidness, the violence, or the mock-ironic ending. What I did mind about the film was its life-denying spirit, its complete lack of curiosity about the possibilities of people.",Taxi Driver
Ian Cameron,"Aided by Robert De Niro's remarkable performance, Taxi Driver works very well... Where it seems most notable, though, is in the extent to which it catches the feeling of paranoia which one can hardly avoid noticing in New York.",Taxi Driver

David Walsh,"Batman Begins is an utterly conventional, conformist work, respectful of order and wealth, unable or unwilling to challenge any of contemporary society's taboos. Worse than that, its grim pomposity and self-seriousness invite only laughter.",Batman Begins
PJ Nabarro,"Batman Begins is certainly a worthy staging post in the inescapably compelling career of Christopher Nolan, and stands the test of time some 15 years after its release.",Batman Begins

David Robinson,Ran takes film spectacle to new heights. Kurosawa continues not only to extend his own powers but to exploit new technical advances.,Ran

David Elliott,"This film is the visual epic of the year, and one of the few really great movies of the 80s.",Ran
Lillian Vallee,"Kurosawa's greatness lies in his capacity to reveal historical similarity and variance; to find a Shakespearean sense of doom in the other, remote, and apparently alien historical place.",Ran

Penelope Gilliatt,"[Yojimbo] is not four-star Kurosawa, but it rates a good three.",Yojimbo
Pauline Kael,"Yojimbo is not a film that needs much critical analysis; its boisterous power and good spirits are right there on the surface. Lechery, avarice, cowardice, coarseness, animality, are rendered by fire; they become joy in life, in even [its] lowest forms.",Yojimbo
Howard Waldstein,"The film hasn't aged a day. Watching Yojimbo now, viewers will feel surprised by how modern it feels.",Yojimbo
Keith Garlington,Kurosawa creates a gritty and audacious period picture that manages to mix action with small bits of dark comedy while constantly showing off his technical savvy.,Yojimbo
Brian Eggert,"Redefining not only a Japanese genre but a Hollywood one, Kurosawa's Yojimbo testifies to the cyclical, international pathways of inspiration driving cinematic art.",Yojimbo
Ian Thomas Malone,"Mifune's broad range beautifully illustrates the complex morality Kurosawa spends his narrative grappling with, a moving exploration of society's worst inclinations.",Yojimbo
David Parkinson,"Yojimbo is intimate to the point of claustrophobia. Its wit is wry, its characters flawed and its world-view uncompromisingly cynical.",Yojimbo
Fred Taomae,"Kurosawa combines his genius with Toshiro Mifune's Venice Film Festival's ""best actor'' performance to come up with a film as suspenseful as [High Noon,] in which Gary Cooper dispatched his foes in the early 1950's American western.",Yojimbo
Clyde Gilmour,"Master-director Akira Kurosawa has come up with another memorable work in this Japanese western, a gory caricature of the familiar cactus saga about the killer-for-hire...",Yojimbo
Dwight MacDonald,"One expects more of Kurosawa. I am told he is parodying our Westerns; if so, the joke is not funny.",Yojimbo
Penelope Houston,"Kurosawa's laconic awareness of the brusque farce of violence, and the permanence of melancholy, holds the film on a special balance between laughter and severity.",Yojimbo
Unknown reviewer,A movie that is both a wow of a show and a masterpiece of misanthropy.,Yojimbo

Clyde Gilmour,"A brilliant, puzzling, shocking export from Japan.",Rashomon

Mike Massie,"Despite a kidnapping premise that has the strength and suspense to pull viewers in, the running time offers a drastic disservice.",Prisoners
Grant Watson,There is a level of bleakness to Villeneuve's film that one usually only sees in the film cultures of Japan and South Korea - a willingness to take a narrative one step further than its audience might be comfortable taking.,Prisoners

Ryan Syrek,"Stuffed to the gills with child abduction, overmedicated depression and familial implosions, director Denis Villeneuve's bloated whodunit is a puppy suicide away from the most joyless way to spend well over two hours.",Prisoners
Brian D. Johnson,"Occasionally I got lost in the labyrinthine plot twists, but at almost two-and-a-half hours there's not an ounce of fat on its gripping narrative.",Prisoners
Leslie Combemale,"Gyllenhaal begins and ends with the same dogged determination, the same pessimism and thinly veiled anger, and the same moral center. Kudos to him, as the actor must build character subtext out of scant scripted development.",Prisoners
C.J. Prince,"Prisoners can be quite good when it chooses to be a regular thriller. Unfortunately it decides to try for more, and comes up short in doing so.",Prisoners
Mattie Lucas,A slow burning powder keg of mystery and emotion that winds up the audience and never lets it go.,Prisoners
Micheal Compton,"For all its bells and whistles, Prisoners feels more like a middle-of-the-road episode of ""Law and Order"" than a film that wants to be a mystery wrapped in a moral dilemma.",Prisoners
Brian Eggert,"A combination of hand-drawn animation and Miyazaki’s most obvious use of computers appears onscreen, dispelling some of the film’s magic through the excessive presence of the medium’s needless modernization.",Howl's Moving Castle

Rachel Wagner,I do find it a bit slow... [but] I'm glad I saw it.,Howl's Moving Castle

Austin Trunick,One of Hayao Miyazaki's strengths is the sense of wonderment and magic that he's able to bring to his films.,Howl's Moving Castle
Dorothy Woodend,"The story is almost the least of it, more important is what is beyond the story: genuine emotion, beauty, a meditation on age and love.",Howl's Moving Castle

Philip French,There is little of the magic and Japanese flavour of such Miyazaki masterpieces as Spirited Away.,Howl's Moving Castle
John Lyttle,"Howl's Moving Castle is Japanese and anime, and therefore automatically more artistic than its US counterparts. The right cultural cachet gives you a lot of leeway.",Howl's Moving Castle

Andrew Dowler,Howl's Moving Castle is a graceful fantasy that builds on the strengths Hayao Miyazaki displayed in Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.,Howl's Moving Castle
Charles Champlin,"In its total recapturing of a past, in its plot, its vivid characterizations, its carefully calculated and accelerating pace, its whole demonstration of a medium mastered, Chinatown reminds you again that motion pictures are larger, not smaller than life.",Chinatown
Charles Johnson,"The miracle of the picture is that the tale itself, composed of so many familiar elements -- and I mean 30-years-of-moviegoing familiar -- is grippingly convincing throughout. It is like going to your first movies all over again.",Chinatown
Penelope Gilliatt,"The film, set in the thirties, from a script by Robert Towne, is wickedly skillful, funny, and socially alert.",Chinatown
Dave Billington,You are slowly drawn deep into the director's trap before he springs his surprises. It's a bit like strolling through a beautiful field of flowers and suddenly being told not to move another step because you are in the middle of a minefield.,Chinatown
Rex Reed,"It is so big and so thrilling and so entertaining that years from now, when we look back on the really important films of the 1970s, Chinatown is likely to be one of the most fondly remembered.",Chinatown
Vincent Canby,"Mr. Polanski and Mr. Towne have attempted nothing so witty and entertaining, being content instead to make a competently stylish, more or less thirtyish movie that continually made me wish I were back seeing The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.",Chinatown
Rosalyn Drexler,"A tremendously interesting movie to watch and to listen to. Roman Polanski, who directed, dredges up the dark slimy things that float beneath a sunlit surface.",Chinatown
Stanley Eichelbaum,"The plot of Chinatown just misses the fascinating beat of first-rate works in the genre. It's a well-made film, however, rich in the thirties' atmosphere.",Chinatown
Andrew Sarris,There was a time in the middle of the movie when I felt that it was lagging behind my expectations. But the ending is as stunning as any I have seen since Day of Wrath.,Chinatown
A.D. Murphy,"Richard Sylbert’s production design is magnificent. The Paramount release, first to bear the producing credit of production chief Robert Evans, has money written all over it.",Chinatown
Stanley Kauffmann,"If Chinatown were shorter and less consciously paradigmatic, it would be a good sinister thriller. But Towne and Polanski are insufficiently innocent.",Chinatown
Kevin Kelly,"Chinatown is a stunner, a superlative movie. And, while it's not specifically comparable, it has the exotic, resonating atmosphere of Casablanca. In other words, I think Towne-Polanski & Co. have made what may become a classic.",Chinatown
R.H. Gardner,"Towne should have spent more time studying the relatively tightly written Raymond Chandler-Dashiell Hammett works he was trying to emulate... Still, it is an interesting film. Dunaway has never been better.",Chinatown
Wayne Harada,"It is toned and polished to emulate the Thirties Detective Yarn. And yes, it's worth a visit. But pass the word -- don't spill the beans.",Chinatown
Joseph Gelmis,"If you like Nicholson and you know what evil lurks in the heart of that most chilling and masterful moviemaker Roman Polanski and enjoy being scared for the sake of someone you care for, you'll love Chinatown.",Chinatown
Daniel Webster,It is part of the film's greatness that Nicholson and the audience see the next horror at the same time without being able to predict the end. Nicholson's portrayal is likely to be remembered for a long time.,Chinatown
Joe Baltake,"Opulent, romantic and movie-ish as all get-out, Roman Polanski's Chinatown is cut from the same belt of cloth as last year's The Sting -- only with more substance, verve and intelligence -- and promises to be just as big a hit.",Chinatown
Alexander Walker,It is a rare experience in the cinema these days -- to see a film succeed so completely in its aim of turning a new buck out of past nostalgia without depreciating in the private eye currency in the process.,Chinatown
John Huddy,"Hailed as a masterwork by quite a few critics, called film of the year by several others, Chinatown turns out merely to be another solid private eye mystery, an attractive film -- but no more.",Chinatown
Duncan Fallowell,"Even to those of you of strong heart, I say hold on to your ventricles. This is a thriller with a capital K. We knew he was good at it, now Polanski stands supreme in the pharmacology of the cinema.",Chinatown

Alan Jones,It is probably the only 3D film that truly realizes the potential of what such a misused medium can offer a talented director.,Dial M for Murder
Mike Massie,"Although the first act is where the franticness resides, the brilliance of the film is in the aftermath.",Dial M for Murder
Derwent May,"Ray Milland is sufficiently suave as the misbegotten genius, and Hitchcock has moved about very sure-footedlv on what continues to be for the most part just a stage.",Dial M for Murder
PJ Nabarro,"The film will mainly be of interest to Hitchcock aficionados and fans of '50s moviemaking - from the décor and costume, to the lovely use of Technicolor.",Dial M for Murder
Tim Dirks,Dial M For Murder (1954) is director Alfred Hitchcock's screen version of English playwright Frederick Knott's script. It was filmed in 3-D with the faddish technology that was available at the time (but already going out of fashion)...,Dial M for Murder
David Keyes,"The movie is worth seeing even now, if for no other aim than to show a man ambitiously experimenting with the devious facets that would inspire greater films.",Dial M for Murder
Tim Brayton,An exercise made by an enormously talented constructor of thrillers in the most fertile period of his career.,Dial M for Murder
Jennie Kermode,The risk with clever thrillers is always that they will focus on pleasing the intellect at the expense of developing more depth. Dial M For Murder is a different kind of animal.,Dial M for Murder
Philip French,"Rather than let someone else mess with a play that has a formal perfection, Hitchcock did the adaptation himself, his only such credit while in Hollywood.",Dial M for Murder
David Parkinson,"Milland's sinister sophistication catches the eye, but Kelly's subtly shaded suffering is superb.",Dial M for Murder
Charlotte O'Sullivan,"Ray Milland is great as cold fish Tony Wendice, a former tennis pro who plans to bump off his adulterous wife. Still, Grace Kelly is mis-cast (or misdirected) as the spouse in question.",Dial M for Murder
Allan Hunter,"The depth of focus, framing of characters and objects and use of the claustrophobic sets add extra pleasure to what was already a thoroughly enjoyable ""perfect crime"" nail-biter.",Dial M for Murder
Peter Bradshaw,"The set-up is ingenious and the ""kill"" scene genuinely thrilling.",Dial M for Murder
Nigel Andrews,Grace Kelly reaches out into the audience for murder scissors; foreground tea tables all but clonk your knees; a tell-tale door key - how many Hitchcock revelation moments feature those! - is brandished inches from your nose.,Dial M for Murder
Matthew Thrift,"Second tier Hitch perhaps, but no less enjoyable for it, and still a marvel of cinematic technique.",Dial M for Murder
David Parkinson,Despite Hitchcock's own reservations this is definitely worth a look. Interesting to his aficionados and darkly funny and depressing in turns.,Dial M for Murder
Emma Dibdin,"A tightly wound psychological parlour game, expanded only slightly from its claustrophobic stage roots.",Dial M for Murder
Emanuel Levy,"This second-tier Hitchcock is best known for Grace Kelly's star turn and sleek production values, including use of 3D.",Dial M for Murder
Mark Johnson,"The performances, set designs, costumes, Technicolor photography, and Max Steiner’s exhilarating score keep this film as bewildering and extravagant a film today as it ever was.",Gone with the Wind

Mike Thorn,Martin Scorsese perfects a configuration of the biopic as self-recognized fiction.,Raging Bull

Nicholas Bell,A surprisingly emotional melodrama bolsters what may stand as the most enjoyable Godzilla movie ever made in Yamazaki's call back to the nuclear creature's origins.,Godzilla Minus One
David Sims,Godzilla himself takes up only a slim chunk of a run time largely devoted to people running around in awe and horror. That is why Godzilla Minus One is a great film rather than merely an impressive feat of monstrous visual effects.,Godzilla Minus One
Jayne Nelson,"Godzilla Minus One refreshes this original tale and, crucially, remembers that it should be a horror movie. Despite this Japanese production's small budget, writer/director Takashi Yamazaki shows off the scaly beast's carnage as inventively as possible.",Godzilla Minus One
Pete Vonder Haar,"But the horror, or evil, in Godzilla Minus One isn't limited to the Big G's rampages. Indeed, Takashi Yamazaki's monster is a secondary source of trauma, and the attendant destruction is dwarfed by the war which immediately preceded his attacks.",Godzilla Minus One
Filipe Freitas,"While Godzilla's new roar is a result of a simple amplification of the original, the overall experience feels fresh and new.",Godzilla Minus One
Jack Murphy,"It's truly astonishing to see what has been achieved here on simply a surface level...But what really sets Minus One apart from its American predecessors is the amount of focus it places on its human characters, as opposed to being solely monster focused.",Godzilla Minus One

Mel Valentin,"Yamazaki uses every cinematic tool available to deliver a harrowingly intense, spectacle-rich experience on par with its bigger-budgeted American counterparts.",Godzilla Minus One
Lyra Hale,[...] the ending that we got in Godzilla: Minus One was an amazing one that showed the power of the human spirit and how the choices we make have consequences that last.,Godzilla Minus One
Dana Stevens,It’s the rare kaiju movie that cares this deeply about the inner lives and motivations of the people scurrying out of the way of the monster’s ginormous thudding feet.,Godzilla Minus One
Louisa Moore,"With mediocre CGI, forced acting, and sluggish pacing, almost everything about this monster movie is painfully dull.",Godzilla Minus One
Walter Chaw,"Takashi Yamazaki's awe-inspiring Godzilla Minus One is the year's grandest spectacle bar none, mixed with Japan's sober reckoning with the horrors of war and the pieces of that atrocity they collectively own.",Godzilla Minus One
Erick Estrada,"An exciting, attractive drama wrapped inside an action movie with stories that make us see the feelings and regrets of post-war Japan...

Mattie Lucas,An elegy for a country looking for atonement after losing its way in macho xenophobia.,Gran Torino
Micheal Compton,"It is rumored this could be the 78-year-old's final film performance. If that is the case, Eastwood goes out on top - creating one of his most memorable characters in his rather impressive acting resume.",Gran Torino
Megan Basham,[The] twist... elevates Gran Torino far above the typical vengeance-wreaking flick.,Gran Torino
Deborah Ross,"It is a flawed movie, vastly overwritten, with characters pointing things out that we've long worked out for ourselves. Still, the self-referentiality of Eastwood's performance ensures that Gran Torino isn't just absorbing, but also moving.",Gran Torino
Daniel Kasman,"...""Gran Torino"" contains within its strangely tight wanderings the utter, dexterous precision of drama-comedy and tragedy-given not to intellect and consideration, but to profound conviction and feeling.",Gran Torino

Mattie Lucas,"Fakes you out, then knocks you flat with a right hook to the heart.",Million Dollar Baby

Josh Larsen,The Passion of the Heston.,Ben-Hur
Mark Johnson,"Ben-Hur remains one of the greatest stories ever told. The antagonizing journey of the main protagonist, incredible cast of thousands, elaborate set designs, and one of the greatest sequences in film history, Ben-Hur is one of the most influential films.",Ben-Hur
Dilys Powell,"[The filmmakers] can't give it an imaginative size to match its physical size... Nevertheless if we must have films of this kind, this is the one to have.",Ben-Hur

Victor Pineyro,"62 years later, there's not much to say more than this is; an absolute masterpiece. What was accomplished narratively and technically all those years ago is a work of film geniuses. [Full review in Spanish]",Ben-Hur
Mike Massie,"Perhaps best known for the intensely climactic and lengthy chariot race, resulting in urban legend stuntmen deaths and one of the most widely recognized sequences ever filmed.",Ben-Hur
Juan Luis Caviaro,"One of Wyler's greatest achievements is the way he portrays Jesus Christ, made with elegance and genius. [Full Review in Spanish]",Ben-Hur
Dwight MacDonald,"Watching it was like waiting at a railroad crossing while an interminable freight train lumbers past, often stopping completely for a while.",Ben-Hur
Rachel Wagner,The chariot race still holds up.,Ben-Hur
Jack Harrison,William Wyler never lets spectacle and size interfere with the elemental passions and conflicts of his human story. The spectacular aspects emerge naturally from the story -- the time and place and the customs of the society in which the characters live.,Ben-Hur
James Berardinelli,"Clocking in at three hours forty-two minutes, Ben-Hur overstays its welcome. Still, despite scenes that occasionally run too long, the movie doesn't start to drag until after the chariot race and many of the early scenes are engaging.",Ben-Hur
Tim Brayton,"The most egregiously boring movie ever graced with the Best Picture Oscar... though in fairness, egregious boredom is one of the cornerstones of the Bible epic genre.",Ben-Hur
Cole Smithey,[VIDEO ESSAY] It's worth sitting through four hours of Charlton Heston's hammy pregnant pauses of strained dialogue and toothy grimaces just to savor the legendary larger-than-life marathon where single rider chariots...,Ben-Hur
Martin Chilton,"Although it is a spectacle film, the story of how a man takes on the tyranny of the Romans, with all sorts of horrible consequences to himself and his family, is powerful and gripping.",Ben-Hur
Renee Schonfeld,"1959 Biblical epic has fierce blood-spilling, cruelty.",Ben-Hur
Glenn Dunks,"At 212 minutes it is far too long, and large swathes of the action appear redundant or unnecessary. ""Bigger than Ben-Hur!"" they say. That may not be a compliment.",Ben-Hur
Peter Freedman,"Some critics believe that William Wyler's box-office smash is no match for the 1925 silent version, but there's no denying that the race that forms the famous climax is one of the most iconic sequences in Hollywood history.",Ben-Hur
Total Film Staff,"Epic in both length and stature, Ben-Hur goes on for-bloody-ever... but the action set-pieces remain unrivalled, even in the age of CGI.",Ben-Hur
R.L. Shaffer,"A masterpiece of epic filmmaking, a profound religious experience and one of the greatest films ever made.",Ben-Hur
Phil Hall,There is no reason to feel guilty about not loving this mammoth epic.,Ben-Hur
Christopher Connor,"It’s not hard to see why The Grand Budapest Hotel has gleaned such love over the past seven years. It is a perfect encapsulation of the best of Anderson’s works, with its fast-paced dialogue and candy coloured visual palette",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Cory Woodroof,"Perhaps the filmmaker’s most culturally relevant works, The Grand Budapest Hotel saw Anderson flex his production design chops as hard as he ever had.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Vadim Rizov,"...a variety of post-production work is highlighted, from color correction of the typically fastidiously coordinated hotel to the mechanics of the dizzying climactic downhill mountain chase...",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Edward Porter,Wes Anderson blends his trademark fanciness with a more rompish style of humour than usual.,The Grand Budapest Hotel
Keith Garlington,It definitely comes more into focus the more times you see it.,The Grand Budapest Hotel
Brian Eggert,"Even from a single viewing, an audience knows they have seen what surely must be one of Anderson's best works to date.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Calum Baker,"Wes Anderson's bright, meticulous style reaches its most complete expression in this painfully poignant period comedy.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Sean Axmaker,"It's is an adventure, a murder mystery, an old-world tale, a storybook fable, and a sinister conspiracy. But under the cake-frosting colors and period gilt is a bittersweet story about a way of life hanging on in a world modernizing and passing it by...",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Dan Bayer,"Something this exciting to look at and listen to, something this light and entertaining, shouldn’t leave a viewer so unsatisfied.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Therese Lacson,It is a gorgeous movie; both comedic as well as emotional until the very last moment. Another great film by Anderson.,The Grand Budapest Hotel
Sophie Charara,This is Wes at his most over-the-top and accessible - somehow simultaneously.,The Grand Budapest Hotel
Kanishk Devgan,"Amongst the whole spread of frequent Anderson collaborators, it is Ralph Fiennes, in the spotlight, who makes the most of every second he has on-screen. The end result is a flurry of cotton candy feelings.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Richard Crouse,"Wes Anderson finds a balance between his highly stylized artistic vision, story and heart.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Mike Massie,"No one crafts characters, worlds, and stories quite like Wes Anderson.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Jordan M. Smith,"The film's wholly fictionalized history and its meticulously composed imagery overlay the darkest thematic innards the filmmaker has yet composed, near-seamlessly melding its war-torn heart with a Mendl's sugary coating.",The Grand Budapest Hotel
Richard Propes,It is a film best experienced with a heart and mind fully open.,The Grand Budapest Hotel

Joanne Laurier,"Wes Anderson's newest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a stylish, fantastical film, sometimes comic and sometimes tragic in its re-imagining...",The Grand Budapest Hotel

Pauline Kael,"Barry Lyndon indicates that Kubrick is thinking through his camera, and that's not really how good movies get made.",Barry Lyndon
Kat Halstead,"It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but there's a dry wit at play that adds a kind of comedy of manners element to the epic drama about a man at once casually unassuming but unwaveringly ambitious.",Barry Lyndon
Christopher Connor,"Make no mistake, Barry Lyndon is one of Stanley Kubrick’s finest films, its status as a less celebrated offering perhaps coming as the result of its position of release being between the vastly more popular A Clockwork Orange and The Shining.",Barry Lyndon
Steve Warren,"It may be the most beautifully photographed movie in history, but that's all it is.",Barry Lyndon
Zita Short,This is the sort of scathing indictment that we rarely see in films and in a time when we don’t trust politicians it seems like Barry Lyndon speaks to modern voters who feel completely disillusioned with the politicians who are meant to represent them.,Barry Lyndon
Michael Bronski,It is beautiful but cold.,Barry Lyndon
Rachel Wagner,"I can see why it won Oscars for score, costumes, art direction and cinematography. All of that is exemplary and very well done",Barry Lyndon
Scott Tompkins,[Barry Lyndon] ends up as little more than an 18th century travelogue. The film proves that technical perfection for the sake of technical perfection is meaningless.,Barry Lyndon
Brian Eggert,"A film that best defines Kubrick's intellect, antisocial withdrawal, and obsessive tenure as a filmmaker, Barry Lyndon is also masterful, technically precise, and narratively complex.",Barry Lyndon
Matt Brunson,"While many consider it brilliant, others find it about as exciting as folding socks.",Barry Lyndon
Nicholas Bell,It is perhaps one of the most revolutionary examples of art-house auteur cinema before or since.,Barry Lyndon
David A. Nardozzi,"Barry Lyndon is exuberant, an exhilarating interplay of comedy, romance, battle, and poignancy.",Barry Lyndon
Adam Nayman,"The sense of torpor simultaneously helps to call attention to the painterly beauty of the images-widescreen compositions evoking the light and coloring of 18th century paintings-and the grim, fatalistic determinism of the narrative...",Barry Lyndon
Jacoba Atlas,Pretentious best describes the 184-minute movie: every scene is filled with expectations of the highest form of expression but none succeed.,Barry Lyndon
Bernard Drew,"There are gorgeous homes and landscapes aplenty, duels, wars, balls -- Kubrick is wonderful on big scenes and small details -- but the big detail of people and why they do what they do has been lost in the shuffle.",Barry Lyndon
Jesús Fernández Santos,"Barry Lyndon is like an excellent encyclopedia... It's boring and exhausting, and ends up being too long, almost ineffective. [Full Review in Spanish]",Barry Lyndon
James Kendrick,"Barry Lyndon is a deeply felt, sometimes brutally ironic, and always visually gorgeous summation of the wide breadth of human experience.",Barry Lyndon
List Staff,"It's a stunning, sumptuous and sustained meditation on man's ultimate powerlessness.",Barry Lyndon
Donald Clarke,"Barry Lyndon is, despite its rigorous construction, also among Kubrick's more emotionally engaged films.",Barry Lyndon
Michael Wilmington,"The wonderfully dry and witty narration is from Thackeray, delivered by Michael Horder.",Barry Lyndon
Erick Estrada,"Without prescriptions or clichés, Fincher manages to show the lights and shadows of the two central characters: the perfect marriage of the common man and the femme fatale. [Full review in Spanish]",Gone Girl
Jason Adams,Tonally sloppy. Things happen to Ben Affleck; Ben Affleck doesn't make things happen.,Gone Girl
Manuel São Bento,"Yet another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight.",Gone Girl
Ezequiel Boetti,"The mystery won't let up. Because the movie and the book formulate deeper doubts that, free from the boundaries of a procedural, allow us to generate (bitter) reflections on conjugal love. [Full review in Spanish]",Gone Girl
Q.V. Hough,"Shocking and delightfully sick, Gone Girl highlight’s America’s fascination with pop culture and the showboating of marriage bliss.",Gone Girl
Sean Axmaker,"... as smart as it is compelling, a wild ride as a mystery and a wickedly entertaining portrait of a marriage between two people who really don’t know each other.",Gone Girl
Vadim Rizov,"I’d love to watch it again, but I’m not sure there’s much to take ideologically from Gone Girl; no one should be proud of anything we might learn about ourselves from this.",Gone Girl
Keith Garlington,The visual presentation is moody and comfortless yet perfectly appropriate. And the music from Fincher favorites Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor creates atmospheres of tension.,Gone Girl
Brian Eggert,"More than the poetry of misdirection, more than disappearances or curdling doubt, more than sinister motives or cunning manipulation, and more shocking than a singularly violent, bloody death, David Fincher's Gone Girl is a portrait of marriage.",Gone Girl
Josh Parham,"Employing crisp cinematography, atmospheric sound design, and an incredibly effective score, Fincher manages to utilize many of these crafts to create an engaging premise that sells an intriguing thematic insight.",Gone Girl
George Fenwick,"A brilliant example of a book-to-film adaptation that managed to stay faithful to the novel, while also injecting the story with its own inventive style.",Gone Girl
Dan Brightmore,Fincher combines a maze-like plot with brutal drama to create an unmissable thriller.,Gone Girl
Cate Young,The dirty little secret of Gone Girl is that Amy never hated men as so many have alleged. Women had always been the true targets of her disdain.,Gone Girl
Richard Crouse,"Not great art, but it is an artfully made potboiler with memorable performances and slick direction that will keep you guessing until the end.",Gone Girl
Leo Brady,"Gone Girl not only entertains, but engages the viewer. This is one creepy masterpiece.",Gone Girl
Marianna Neal,Deliciously twisted!,Gone Girl
Ashley Lara,"Fincher and Flynn marry conventions of the thriller with conventions of rom-com, creating a game for the audience to follow along the way.",Gone Girl
Mike Massie,Built with a masterful touch.,Gone Girl
Kelechi Ehenulo,"Watching Gone Girl was like watching Fatal Attraction, Misery and War of the Roses all wrapped up in one and yet you still couldn't get close to what this film was.",Gone Girl
Brent McKnight,Low trash as high art.,Gone Girl
Keith Garlington,"The superbly shot battle scenes aside, Gibson’s traditionalist sensibilities show up in how he shoots everything else which is a perfect fit for this particular film. It’s easy to get lost in the period he visualizes.",Hacksaw Ridge
Brian Eggert,"Hacksaw Ridge seems at odds with itself, particularly during the chaotic and gruesome second half, as it tells a story about a brave pacifist while also satiating the filmmaker's long-demonstrated bloodlust.",Hacksaw Ridge
Matt Brunson,"Mel Gibson's direction can hardly be deemed inspired, but because he's less ham-fisted in his jingoistic zeal than Peter Berg, his workmanlike efficiency at least rarely gets in the way of a worthy storyline.",Hacksaw Ridge
Leo Brady,"Hacksaw Ridge sends us into the trenches, displays what one can achieve with faith, and honors the courageous character of Desmond Doss.",Hacksaw Ridge
Rudie Obias,"Overall, the movie doesn't add up to much.",Hacksaw Ridge
Mike Massie,"It's as if Gibson wants to impart a message of peaceful religious convictions while also reenacting grisly, high-octane war moments.",Hacksaw Ridge
Richard Propes,Is Gibson glorifying the violence that Doss nearly gave his life to shun? Perhaps.,Hacksaw Ridge
Joanne Laurier,...fatally and hopelessly flawed...,Hacksaw Ridge
Kelechi Ehenulo,Hacksaw Ridge has its heart in the right place but gets off to an uneven start and in some respects you could accuse this film as being Oscar bait.,Hacksaw Ridge
Ricardo Gallegos,Mel Gibson is a monster when filming action: he has a gift for directing violence. [Full review in Spanish],Hacksaw Ridge
Josh Encinias,Hacksaw Ridge is about an unbelievable man doing unbelievable things for people who don't like him.,Hacksaw Ridge
Yasser Medina,"We can say Gibson have returned to the violent historical drama for which his style has been characterized, but now he manages to catch us with a poignant anti-war film that talks about the horrors of war. [Full review in Spanish]",Hacksaw Ridge
Avaryl Halley,"I had a lot of problems with it, but I still found it entertaining and powerful.",Hacksaw Ridge
Andrew Galdi,This movie was not skillfully made. It was not nuanced.,Hacksaw Ridge
Steven Prokopy,"Hacksaw Ridge is certainly not for everybody, but I found it absolutely captivating, thought provoking, sometimes morally off kilter, but never compromised. If you can stomach the gore, you're in for one jaw-dropping experience.",Hacksaw Ridge
Dan Scully,Hacksaw Ridge is an epic film of the grandest tradition.,Hacksaw Ridge
Valerie Kalfrin,"The cinematography, editing, and sound pack a surprising amount of suspense, no small feat considering audiences know the outcome.",Hacksaw Ridge
Debbie Lynn Elias,Hacksaw Ridge is masterful filmmaking!,Hacksaw Ridge
Nicholas Bell,"Schmaltzy and hackneyed, despite some glaring bits of hard-won, gritty emotion.",Hacksaw Ridge
Andrew Todd,Feels like a movie made during World War II to drum up enlistments - with all the dodgy moralising that entails.,Hacksaw Ridge
Irish Times Staff,It is easy to be a comedian; but Chaplin is something more. Behind all his ludicrous antics there is a deeps sympathy with human weakness.,The Gold Rush
Wesley Lovell,The film captures the humor and the tragedy of one man’s life in the gold rush era and the end is inspirationally poetic.,The Gold Rush
Sean Axmaker,"Charlie Chaplin’s frozen north classic is just as funny today as it was seventy years ago, and just as mawkishly sentimental.",The Gold Rush

Edwin Schallert,The first comedy of epic proportions has reached the screen.,The Gold Rush
Edgar Anstey,It is a delight to see again how Chaplin utilises every second of screen-time.,The Gold Rush
Iris Barry,"Let no one fail to appreciate those small details, of [Chaplin's] perfectly timed and quite exquisite acting, as when he has most kindly boiled one of his famous boots for a starving miner-pal, and serves it up after due testing with a fork.",The Gold Rush
Richard Brody,"Chaplin is the apotheosis of the world's despised and downtrodden, and also their hope; he heralds a revolution in anarchic beauty.",The Gold Rush
Edmund Wilson,"I prophesied that Chaplin, with his finer comedy and his less spectacular farce, would not be able to hold his popularity against it. What has happened is precisely the reverse of what I predicted.",The Gold Rush
James Agee,"The result is a sight for sore eyes, for old-style Chaplin fans and novitiates alike.",The Gold Rush
Eric Melin,"It shows Chaplin mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself.",The Gold Rush
Matt Brunson,No one can mix slapstick and sentimentality quite like Chaplin.,The Gold Rush
Bill Weber,"Even with its (likely dictated) propaganda on behalf of the now-superfluous 1942 edition, this set restores a high watermark in cinematic comedy to nearly full glory.",The Gold Rush
Graeme Tuckett,"In The Name Of The Father is a gritty, compelling and engrossing film. Day-Lewis is extraordinary, of course.",In the Name of the Father
David Ansen,Jim Sheridan tells his gripping tale with a fury that stokes up an audience the way early Costa Gavras movies used to do.,In the Name of the Father
Gene Siskel,Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.,In the Name of the Father
Kenneth Turan,"In the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.",In the Name of the Father
John Hartl,"At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.",In the Name of the Father
Terrence Rafferty,"The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.",In the Name of the Father
Candice Russell,"In the Name of the Father is a deeply stirring film that lessens the moral authority of the I.R.A., English soldiers in Ireland, the British police and the British government.",In the Name of the Father
Desmond Ryan,"Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.",In the Name of the Father
Unknown reviewer,"If Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.",In the Name of the Father
Jay Boyar,The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.,In the Name of the Father
Sue Heal,"This is a stirring and exceptionally well acted, though controversial, dramatisation of Gerry Conlon's book about the grave miscarriage of justice suffered by the Guildford Four.",In the Name of the Father
David Sterritt,"Day-Lewis outdoes his acclaimed performance in My Left Foot, making Gerry a character of palpable realness and complexity.",In the Name of the Father
Emanuel Levy,"In this powerful, Oscar-nominated movie, Jim Sheridan infuses a fact-based social injustice drama with a more intimate family tale of estranged father and son, splendidly played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Peter Postlethwaite.",In the Name of the Father
Richard Corliss,"By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.",In the Name of the Father
Owen Gleiberman,[Sheridan] works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design.,In the Name of the Father
Unknown reviewer,Sheridan takes a controversial subject and gives it wider appeal by focusing on the family drama of two men who are also political prisoners.,In the Name of the Father
Todd McCarthy,"Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.",In the Name of the Father
Kim Newman,Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.,In the Name of the Father
Unknown reviewer,Director Sheridan chronicles the father-son relationship perfectly and also handles the courtroom confrontations skilfully without ever falling into movie melodramatics.,In the Name of the Father
Jonathan Rosenbaum,"The acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.",In the Name of the Father

Kurt Jacobsen,"We never are privy to Keatings’s personal life, nor do we quite grasp why such a talented individual is devoted to pedagogy.",Dead Poets Society
Mark Jackson,"I'd originally found it inspiring in 1989 but upon reviewing DPS in 2021, I've come to see it as the poster child (or movie poster) for the insidious, creeping way Hollywood helped sneak communism, Trojan-horse-wise, into America via the movies.",Dead Poets Society
Danielle Solzman,Robin Williams may have been famous because of his comedy work but his non-comedy role in Dead Poets Society is one of his best performances.,Dead Poets Society
Gene Siskel,A refreshing if obvious drama.,Dead Poets Society
Hank Gallo,"On the surface Robin Williams appears to be giving his standard performance as Prof. Keating - witty, sincere and lovable. But there's much more here.",Dead Poets Society
Josh Larsen,I can't help but melt underneath this movie: it chisels away the cynic and gets at the sap.,Dead Poets Society
Odie Henderson,"Dead Poets Society purports to be about the bravery of following one's own path. This is a bright, shining lie, one the film is ballsy enough to tell to your face.",Dead Poets Society
Jeffrey M. Anderson,"It's not so easy to dismiss Dead Poets Society. For all its faults, it still has as much power as it ever did.",Dead Poets Society
James Plath,"Williams keeps a stiff upper lip, showing a more sedate and sensitive side, and the Oscar-winning screenplay provides a strong backbone.",Dead Poets Society
Dennis Schwartz,Falters when it goes for too much heart-tugging manipulation.,Dead Poets Society
Randy White,"Inspiring, intense story of a teacher and his students.",Dead Poets Society
Angie Errigo,Beautifully directed and with an Oscar-winning story.,Dead Poets Society
Richard Schickel,"Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.",Dead Poets Society
Unknown reviewer,"A film that celebrates the importance of inspiration, albeit in slightly affected fashion.",Dead Poets Society
Brian Orndorf,"A bundle of growing pain blues, flamboyant declarations of self, and doomsday faculty foul-ups, and it cooks when delivered in big batches of adolescent passion.",Dead Poets Society
Rory L. Aronsky,"Watch ""Dead Poets Society"" and you'll see the efforts of a filmmaker who has his own loving style in making movies.",Dead Poets Society
Emanuel Levy,"Though sentimental and contrived, this valentine to charismatic, dedicated teachers is extremely well acted (even by Robin Williams) and it does make you feel good about loving literature and poetry.",Dead Poets Society
Brian Eggert,"Not every story will resonate, and the overall theme doesn't leave one with a sense of their combined profundity, but three or four stories are bound to feel familiar and thus deliciously watchable.",Wild Tales

Yasser Medina,"The thing is, the movie is entertaining, and it's contagious when it mocks the idiosyncrasies of a cynical civilization. [Full review in Spanish]",Wild Tales
Chris McCoy,Revealing more than the barest plot information about the individual segments would spoil the wicked pleasure of watching things quickly escalate into the realm of the absurd.,Wild Tales
Karl Delossantos,"Damián Szifron tells each story with a specific visual flair that helps make ""Wild Tales"" the best anthology movie I've ever seen.",Wild Tales

Alex Heeney,"Wild Tales is an inventively shot crowd-pleaser, but it could stand to lose the fifth short.",Wild Tales
Alistair Ryder,"Although it may not be for everyone due to its pitch-black tone, Wild Tales is a film that I imagine everybody who sees it can relate to in some way.",Wild Tales
Dwight Brown,"It's rare that a casting director's genius is so obvious, but Javier Braier pulls together a huge, disparate cast that is dopey, baiting, mean or gloriously evil at the right times.",Wild Tales
Dennis Schwartz,A wickedly funny farce about the blurred lines of morality crossed when seeking revenge.,Wild Tales
Ed Potton,"Malloy makes an unlikely proxy for Kazan, though. A former boxer with the eyes of a showgirl, he was the role of a lifetime for Brando, whose Method-schooled blend of machismo and vulnerability redefined acting for a generation.",On the Waterfront
Chris Bennion,"The supporting cast is wonderful, but it’s Brando who lights up every part of this film.",On the Waterfront
Peter Bradshaw,"The performances in the film have a magnificent intelligence and strength, shaped and guided incomparably by Kazan, a master of Broadway and Hollywood.",On the Waterfront
Vernon Young,"It has a persuasiveness of characterization, for the most part, rare on the American screen, not because actors are lacking to convey it but because it is so seldom elicited either by their material or their directors.",On the Waterfront
Wael Khairy,"Even though there's not a single scene where sluggers dance around within the confines of a ring, Kazan's film is in fact a boxing film in disguise.",On the Waterfront
Mark Johnson,"Known for the powerful portrayal of anguish that permanently changed acting, Marlon Brando gives one of – if not THE – greatest performances of all time.",On the Waterfront
Dilys Powell,"The film is splendidly acted. This is the third time that Marlon Brando has played under Kazan's direction, and this time my reservations about his gifts disappear. As the racketeer's errand boy... his performance is magnificent.",On the Waterfront
Pauline Kael,"It is one of the most powerful American movies of the 50s, and few movies caused so much talk, excitement, and dissension -- largely because of Marlon Brando's performance as the inarticulate, instinctively alienated bum, Terry Malloy.",On the Waterfront
Robert Bingham,Although there is excellent support -- notably from Lee J. Cobb and Karl Malden -- without Mr. Brando’s pervasive personality On the Waterfront could certainly not have been what it now is: the best American picture seen so far this year.,On the Waterfront
André Bazin,"On the Waterfront's value as a gangster film is in itself mediocre. The best of the picture lies elsewhere, in the character of Marlon Brando... I don't know of any young movie actor in the world who can compare with him.",On the Waterfront
Ian Kane,"""On the Waterfront"" can be considered not only as one of the finest achievements in filmmaking, but also as Kazan's metaphor for standing up for what's right and calling out evil wherever one may find it.",On the Waterfront
Moira Walsh,Elia Kazan's direction is uncannily apt in capturing the essentials of interior conflict in visual terms.,On the Waterfront
Russ Burton,"[Brando's] portrayal Is powerful, incisive and complete, and they can put his name on the Oscar now and save the etcher time.",On the Waterfront

James Wegg,We're entitled to it,On the Waterfront
Hortense Morton (Screen Scout),"There isn't a weak spot in this film. Photography is excellent aided by typical backgrounds. And, certainly the story, almost documentary, is honest, if too familiar.",On the Waterfront
Marjory Adams,"On the Waterfront is strong, tough and cruelly violent, but it is also a film that should make theatre history for 1954. It will strike audiences with special impact because it is based on undisputed fact.",On the Waterfront
Janet Graves,"Marlon Brando has a rewarding assignment in this smashing melodrama, full of the frightening sounds and sights of racket-haunted docks.",On the Waterfront
Jane Corby,"On the Waterfront is not a mere expose of conditions that recently prevailed in some waterfront sections; it goes further than that. It has taken the findings of investigators and presents them here in perspective, ranged alongside of human values.",On the Waterfront
Mae Tinee,The film has a ring of authenticity. It is as close to the unvarnished truth as has been seen on the screen in many a day and a shining example of intelligent use of a medium too seldom utilized to its greatest extent.,On the Waterfront
Sean Burns,"There’s something elemental about the movie’s boys’ adventure machismo, a primal force that overpowers Cimino’s more cartoonish flourishes.",The Deer Hunter
Mark Johnson,"Michael Cimino’s tale about the physical, emotional, and psychological impacts the Vietnam War had on a group of friends remains one of film's ultimate masterpieces. Very few movies have ever captured the unsparing aftermath of war quite as devastatingly.",The Deer Hunter
Wendy Ide,"... Perhaps a little cumbersome, but it’s hard not to get caught up in the film’s big, sentimental sweep.",The Deer Hunter
Richard Corliss,"It grabs you by the lapel and says, ""Call me masterpiece!""... These weaknesses are The Deer Hunter's greatest strength -- because, in a year of timid moviemaking, they trumpet the film's daring to fail at being great.",The Deer Hunter
Stephen Tee,"Graphic in its depictions of war and peace, honest in its capturing of human emotion, Deer Hunter is an epic that avoids political points to stress the basic needs we all share.",The Deer Hunter
LIFE Staff,Robert De Niro reclaims his title as our finest young dramatic male star in a devastating anti-war epic.,The Deer Hunter
Stephen Farber,"In terms of sheer impact, this is the best movie of 1978; it restores power and urgency to the screen.",The Deer Hunter
Stanley Kauffmann,"So many of the elements are so good that it all adds up to a pity. Someone, or more than one -- writer or producers or director or editor or all -- fogged up about why this picture was being made and whether it was on the rails.",The Deer Hunter
Charles Champlin,"A film to be debated and argued over seriously because it is an earnest, serious and impressive work, despite the reservations it is necessary to have about it. In a thin and evasive year, The Deer Hunter joins a thin company that aspire to greatness.",The Deer Hunter
Bob Thomas,"The Deer Hunter might have been a superb document of the devastation to human lives caused by the Vietnam war... But director Michael Cimino allows the story to drag on past three hours, with endless scenes of male camaraderie and war atrocity.",The Deer Hunter
Bernard Drew,"Despite its faults, The Deer Hunter is a formidable work which asks a great deal of its audience. The graphic brutality of the Vietnam scenes are devastatingly rendered, and it is a pulverizing experience.",The Deer Hunter
Richard Freedman,"It is a flawed but important movie, both as a work of art and for what it has to tell us about ourselves.",The Deer Hunter
Rex Reed,"There is no denying the impact of the film, but it should've been twice as harrowing in half the time.",The Deer Hunter
Andrew Sarris,"Far from achieving Tolstoyan heights, however, Cimino fails even to attain a Scorsesian or Coppolian level. The structure of the film is so rickety, and the details so incongruous, that whatever feelings were intended finally peter out.",The Deer Hunter
Perry Stewart,"The combat scenes are painfully graphic and, while it concludes on a hopeful note, The Deer Hunter remains an emotional thunderbolt which is apt to send you out of the Opera House Cinema in a state of profound cinematic shell shock.",The Deer Hunter
David Denby,"This movie has qualities that we almost never see any more -- range and power and breadth of experience, all fully sustained throughout three hours of film that leave us exhausted and satisfied by the end.",The Deer Hunter
Romola Costantino,This unwieldy film batters its audience; perhaps this is the painful catharsis which American audiences want.,The Deer Hunter
Jack Kroll,"The Deer Hunter is a film of great courage and overwhelming emotional power, a fiercely loving embrace of life in a death-ridden time. And it places the director-writer-producer, 37-year-old Michael Cimino, right at the center of our film culture.",The Deer Hunter
Jay Boyar,"The actors are so natural, so real, so privately panic-stricken in the face of death, that their performances ride rough-shod over the technical situation and bring to it an intensity and vitality.",The Deer Hunter
Michael Lasky,The acting ensemble is what carries the sheer force of this movie to its nerve-wracking heights. De Niro captures the minute essence of his character and ignites the screen with a sharp-edged realism that it as once frightening and inspiring.,The Deer Hunter

Jordan Brooks,"Surpassing expectations and delivering a heaping dose of electrifying visuals, Mad Max: Fury Road is what all blockbuster action movies should strive to be.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Jennifer Bisset,The entire movie takes place over one absolutely bonkers chase sequence. Its cinematic stats are jaw-dropping...,Mad Max: Fury Road
Vadim Rizov,"What follows is not quite as routinely life-threatening, but it’s still incredibly physical filmmaking. $150 million, it seems, will buy you the budget to stand in the desert and sling a camera around...",Mad Max: Fury Road
Keith Garlington,This is pure action cinema – a beautiful mixture of old-school style and modern movie technology.,Mad Max: Fury Road
Brian Eggert,"The viewer becomes swept up in the forward-moving narrative impetus, thrilled to audible gasps by Miller’s wonderfully excessive parade of stunts and effects, each more impressive and more fantastically outlandish than the last.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Danilo Castro,"It is the rare, beautiful film that can take even the most staunch of cinephiles and reduce them to a giddy child, flush with excitement and rooting for the heroes to win.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Cory Woodroof,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a slobbernocking achievement that also happens to be a singular experience, best seen on the most gargantuan screen possible with friends, soda, candy and a jaw that can be dropped at will.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Therese Lacson,"The definition of a wholly unapologetically action-packed film, Mad Max: Fury Road breathes new life into an old series...",Mad Max: Fury Road
Kip Mooney,"It's hard to see another movie equalling this one's grand ambition, deep ideas and awe-inspiring action.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Hannah Hodson,"In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters?... [Also] how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?!",Mad Max: Fury Road

Brittani Nichols,Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums.,Mad Max: Fury Road

Gabrielle Rivera,I had my palm raised to the universe the second [Charlize Theron's Furiosa] took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert.,Mad Max: Fury Road
Nathan Mattise,"The film offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Kanishk Devgan,"You'll have to watch it to see how it took us to new heights of energetic, ambitious, emotionally resonant, intelligent, exhilarating, and political filmmaking.",Mad Max: Fury Road
Dustin Chang,"On top of all the crazy good stuff, there are a bandit of kick ass grannies living in the desert! (I mean, Miller must be channeling some Ursula K. Le Guin fan fiction here, jesus christ) And it works! Miraculously!",Mad Max: Fury Road
Sarah Marshall,Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie with the kind of reach most people - and even most movies - can only aspire to.,Mad Max: Fury Road
Mike Massie,Less a remake and more a reinvention of Miller's own postapocalyptic action movie genre.,Mad Max: Fury Road

Dennis Harvey,"Buster Keaton’s 1924 Sherlock Jr., perhaps the ultimate proof of his ingeniousness...",Sherlock Jr.
Kenneth Taylor,"As the small town motion-picture projectionist who is studying to be a detective on the side, Keaton is seen to great advantage. The picture seems to be funnier than Our Hospitality, measuring well up to the standard of Three Ages.",Sherlock Jr.
Herman Shumlin,"It is packed with laughable incidents, ridiculous tricks that will cause roars of real belly-laughs, and will send them home just a bit ashamed at having laughed so much, just as it did this reviewer.",Sherlock Jr.
Roy Ellarcotte,"[Sherlock, Jr.] is about the best thing this ""straight face"" comedian has done.",Sherlock Jr.
Robert E. Sherwood,"Like all Keaton comedies Sherlock, Jr., is constructed with amazing ingenuity.",Sherlock Jr.
Mordaunt Hall,"There is an extremely good comedy which will give you plenty of amusement, so long as you permit Mr. Keaton to glide into his work with his usual deliberation.",Sherlock Jr.
Fred Schader,This Buster Keaton feature length comedy is about as unfunny as a hospital operating room... The chances are that this picture will turn about the lowest gross of any of the Keaton's that Metro has thus far handled.,Sherlock Jr.
J. Ray Murray,"It hasn’t the pep in the early footage -- a thing so necessary in a feature length comedy -- and lacks sprightly gags to hold it together. Rather surprised, too, that Keaton resorted to the old dream sequence to pad it out. He is usually more original.",Sherlock Jr.
Michael L. Simmons,Pleasurable entertainment for the family; laughs galore for the case-hardened. Fun for young and old alike. It's just the prettiest piece of feature comedy work the writer has seen in many weeks of movie-going.,Sherlock Jr.
C.S. Sewell,"Right here we want to say that we never saw so many gags and such original ones as are unfolded in Sherlock, Jr. It is an unusually cleverly constructed comedy film and Buster and his gag men deserve credit for their ingenuity.",Sherlock Jr.
Martin Dickstein,"The result, is seven or eight reels of asininity, spread out thin to cover the distance, with Just about enough really, funny incidents to make it a screaming two-reeler.",Sherlock Jr.
Ralph Flint,"His third [feature] lacks the continuity and adroitness of the earlier pictures, albeit there are hilarious novelties sprinkled through the latter part of the film.",Sherlock Jr.
Shadow Stage,"This is by no means Keaton's most hilarious offering, but it is short, snappy and amusing. Comedies are like oases in a celluloid world, rare and refreshing, and you don't want to miss Buster with his immobile face and unique composure in his new setting.",Sherlock Jr.
New York Post Staff,"Keaton is about as funny as we have ever seen him. Later on the story slumps a bit, but he manages to pick it up and end it with a loud and resounding bang of laughter.",Sherlock Jr.

Roger Moore,The perfect thriller,The Third Man
Vernon Young,"These means to fluidity, surprise, and persuasion, combined with the unreal reality of war-stripped Vienna and the incidental locales... give the whole film a percussive fluency, like a plausibly scripted nightmare.",The Third Man
Mark Johnson,The preeminent film noir of all time.,The Third Man
Keith Garlington,The story never hits a lull nor does it ever overplay it’s hand. It’s intelligent and well constructed and I was consumed by both the narrative and the environment in took place in.,The Third Man
Edwin F. Melvin,"Carol Reed is a master of the art of building melodramatic suspense, equally adept at employing sight and sound to achieve his purpose.",The Third Man
Richard L. Coe,"It’s all neatly sewn together and recalls the early Hitchcock spy chasers, The Lady Vanishes and the 39 Steps. The playing is fitted nicely to the director’s and writer’s specifications and there are some appealing portraits limned by Austrian actors.",The Third Man
Cole Smithey,has one of the greatest chase sequences ever filmed  and it doesnt involve cars.,The Third Man
Brian Eggert,"Reed remains the picture's greatest asset, even if he is not the first name that comes to mind when remembering The Third Man.",The Third Man
Matt Neal,Welles' Harry Lime looms over the narrative just as the shadow of World War II looms over the film's post-war Vienna.,The Third Man

Sarah Brinks,"It isn't a particularly challenging film but it is entertaining, it moves at a quick pace, and the mystery at the heart of it is fun to try and piece together.",The Third Man
Mike Massie,"As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful.",The Third Man
Allen Almachar,"The writing, the acting, the music, and the locations are so distinct and recognizable that they have become lodged in our consciousness.",The Third Man
Ed Potton,"Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero.",The Third Man
Jay Carmody,"The astounding acting bit, it may turn out, is that contributed by Orson Welles. As the object of this chilling search, Welles for once is pulled back to the size of a gifted actor, a trick for which he and a lot of old Welles' admirers can thank Reed.",The Third Man
Lisa Nesselson,The music is as distinctive as the James Bond or Star Wars theme...,The Third Man
Sean Axmaker,"This film is lively, always moving forward, constantly bubbling with mystery and suspicion and secrets, but the characters are always driving the film.",The Third Man
Quentin Curtis,We're seduced out of caring for Greene's weary plot. Welles saves the film and destroys it.,The Third Man

Chase Hutchinson,"Where the original remains a work of art that is as entertaining as it is well-made, this remake proves to be nothing more than an empty and thunderously stupid approximation of an action film. Neither thrilling nor tense, it's simply dead on arrival.",The Wages of Fear
Sean Axmaker,"It’s an often painful drama and [Victor] Sjöström gives a vulnerable, moving performance as the crotchety, morally imperious old man... but it’s also one of Bergman’s warmest, most understanding, and most beautiful films.",Wild Strawberries
David Pountain,Bergman's penchant for giving physical form to the conscious and subconscious mind is rarely more apparent than in his 1957 masterpiece Wild Strawberries.,Wild Strawberries

Michael J. Casey,One of Bergman's best in a six-decade-long career littered with masterpieces.,Wild Strawberries

Sarah Brinks,Wild Strawberries is a simple film on paper but on screen it is a meditative look at one man's life.,Wild Strawberries
Tim Brayton,A celebration of the power of actors to create rich personalities for us to spend time with.,Wild Strawberries
Isabel Quigly,"Wild Strawberries is to my mind a far more complete and interesting film than the much over- praised Seventh Seal, for the simple reason that it says something negative.",Wild Strawberries
Pablo Villaça,"Bergman understands one of the most bittersweet characteristics of nostalgia: it juxtaposes our memories, in which everyone is young and healthy, and the inevitable reality of physical decline that followed. [Full review in Portuguese.]",Wild Strawberries
Fernando F. Croce,Bergman's dual journey of remembrances and reveries,Wild Strawberries
Cole Smithey,"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Wild Strawberries"" is a thematically abundant film that fluidly condenses a lifetime's worth of experience into succinct cinematic fragments under Ingmar Bergman's complex construction of abstract corollaries.",Wild Strawberries
Josh Larsen,...an intensely cinematic psychological portrait of a man reckoning with the how and why of who he's become.,Wild Strawberries
David Parkinson,Gunnar Fischer's photography becomes ever more luminous and Sjstrm's performance grows in greatness.,Wild Strawberries
Charlie Jackson,"The relentless symbolism, and some rather heavy-handed dream sequences are off-putting at times, but Wild Strawberries has enough sorrow, warmth and profundity to make for sophisticated and rewarding viewing.",Wild Strawberries
Unknown reviewer,"If some of the symbolism is a bit top-heavy, Bergman's richly evocative contrasts of youth with age more than compensate, as does Sjstrm's majestic performance.",Wild Strawberries
Robert Hatch,A reviewer must exercise some tact in discussing this picture. It is a work of such high and subtle art that the temptation is to run in with a smother of adjectives and a display of analytical explanation.,Wild Strawberries
Eric Melin,"Bergman's often heralded masterpiece of European cinema is more than a formal delight. It's funny, touching, and very, very emotional.",Wild Strawberries
Phil Villarreal,Swedish master Ingmar Bergman delivered one of his greatest ruminations on love and life in this 1957 drama.,Wild Strawberries
Donald J. Levit,"Several actors who were to form the director's virtual stock company are here, but it is Sjstrm who is heart and soul of the film.",Wild Strawberries
Variety Staff,It's a personal and profound work.,Wild Strawberries
Patrick Cavanaugh,"A miraculous achievement from all aspects, Spielberg weaves together drama, humor, adventure, and horror expertly and plays the audience like a fiddle. The main trio of stars are tremendous in their roles.",Jaws
Cory Woodroof,"Jaws is the pinnacle of shark movies, one of the greatest films ever made and still as wholly terrifying and relentlessly fun as it was when it came out in 1975.",Jaws
Howard Waldstein,"Anchored by performances by Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and the inimitable Robert Shaw, the film is a poignant character study of men with vastly different reasons for embarking on a mission into the great unknown.",Jaws
Rob Gonsalves,"Not that it doesn’t pack scares and thrills, but it has a peculiarly ’70s appetite for small character detail.",Jaws
Gary Jane Hoisington,"Rivetingly obvious special effects, marginal acting by Robert Shaw, and an Academy performance by the shark, if you like animal acts.",Jaws
Brian Eggert,A carefully composed and genuinely great piece of filmmaking Steven Spielberg accomplished through unimaginable circumstances.,Jaws
Kristy Strouse,"It's immortalized for good reason. Between the thematic score, its perfect cast, and gut-punch of a thrill, Jaws is still very much alive.",Jaws
Jason Shawhan,Jaws (1975) is a classic that defined the modern Summer Movie Blockbuster as we know it. It still plays like gangbusters and will make you deeply nervous around water.,Jaws
Robin Holabird,"A relatively inexperienced director Steven Spielberg found a ""less is more"" visual approach heightened suspense in the movie's early scenes. Characters to care about helped, along with spot-on editing by Verna Fields.",Jaws
Niall Browne,"Jaws may be Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement. Sure, Schindler's List may get more critical kudos and Indiana Jones may be more iconic - but Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of Peter Benchley's aquatic thriller is a masterpiece from start to finish.",Jaws
Sarah Brinks,"I have always been a fan of ""creature features"" and monster movies and Jaws is that and so much more. It is endlessly rewatchable and fun.",Jaws
Fico Cangiano,"The father of all blockbusters, Steven Spielberg's film is a masterpiece under and above water. To this date, still makes me scared of swimming in the sea. [Full review in Spanish]",Jaws
Jordan M. Smith,"Jaws remains a classic not just for how it changed the film industry, but because it is an exquisitely made monster movie that tapped into universal human fears and did so with iconic style.",Jaws
Mike Massie,"It can be appreciated entirely for its extraordinary entertainment value, nail-biting suspense, sense of adventure, and old-fashioned Hitchcockian scare-tactics.",Jaws
Katie Duggan,"Even decades after its blockbuster release, Jaws is still horrifying, as well as terrifyingly prescient about the current public health and safety crisis.",Jaws
Allen Almachar,"Here is the moment that would forever change how movies are made, marketed, and watched.",Jaws
Adam Nayman,"The beauty of Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic is that you can choose how to watch it: as a summery, shark-bitten thriller or as an allegory about the failed leadership of institutions...",Jaws
Adam Kempenaar,"...more interesting is where the political and personal intersect... which fits nicely with what the movie as a whole does so well, mixing the horror and adventure with the personal.",Jaws
Allison Rose,"Jaws was just the beginning of an ever-amazing career for Spielberg and has left audiences with a number of quotable lines including the very popular, ""You're going to need a bigger boat"".",Jaws

Matt Risley,"Undoubtedly Dreamworks' best film yet, and quite probably the best dragon movie ever made.",How to Train Your Dragon

Marion Aitchison,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is bang-up entertainment -- if we were one to scatter around stars we'd give it four of them. It is swiftly paced and bright with humor to balance its more serious implications.,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington

James T. Hamada,"James Stewart and Claude Rains easily give their best performances to date. Edward Arnold is also impressive and he is probably at his best, too.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington

Elaine Klepper,"Get set, folks, for a ""rave"" notice, for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington deserves no less than a bushel of raves.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Virginia Wright,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is brilliantly amusing. It presents a pride of country amidst typically American self conscious laughter. Its flag waving is of the most subtle kind, because it makes you laugh.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Jack Moffitt,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [is] a picture as hearty and jolly as Santa Claus, as rich in human juices as a turkey is in gravy. If there are any old chestnuts in the dressing they are made palatable by the Capra flavor. You'll relish the whole thing.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Lois Svensrud,"When Mr. Smith goes to Washington, he takes Mr. Average American with him to learn both the good and the bad of what goes on there. The picture is a thought-provoker, done with a simplicity that is smoldering dynamite.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Herbert Cohn,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [is] a meaningful social commentary and a delightful bundle of entertainment despite its weaknesses. For that the credit goes to Capra, to Stewart and to Miss Arthur.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington

Ardis Smith,[Stewart] is more fiery in this performance than one is accustomed to expect... With Mr. Capra's expertness human touches are injected into the play which bring laughs one after the other like machine-gun fire or stir emotions to the depths.,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Nelson Burns (Te Pana),"It is as bold a venture as the screen has launched in years; a pointed and direct attack on graft in the Senate. Although it is true 'Americana' it is a project we should praise delightedly, not merely for its purpose, but for its value as entertainment.",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
Dick Pitts,"It's the kind of stuff out of which Capra the Miracle Man makes entertainment. He makes you laugh and he makes you cry.  And when it's all over you leave the theater chuckling and saying to yourself, Capra's done it again.""",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington

George Campbell Dixon,"The plot, as you see, is shop-worn and the sentimental philosophising dear to Mr Capra’s heart is as obtrusive as in Lost Horizon and You Can't Take It With You.

Mike Massie,"Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature.",Ratatouille

Jeffrey Overstreet,"There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste.",Ratatouille

Mike Davies,The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.,Ratatouille
AP Kryza,"It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles.",Ratatouille

Joanna Connors,"Leave it to Joel and Ethan Coen to wake up a drowsy movie genre with a bucket of ice water, a giant alarm clock and a fistful of No-Doz. The Big Lebowski... injects a mammoth syringe of adrenaline lunacy directly into the overdosed heart of film noir.",The Big Lebowski
Jeff Simon,"In American movies, the Coens are the reigning eccentric poets of the loser class. Who else could get away with quoting Theodore Herzl in a bowling alley?",The Big Lebowski
Peter Travers,A hilarious pop-culture hash. The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever set mostly in a bowling alley.,The Big Lebowski
Elvis Mitchell,"A likably off-balance, screwball comedy mystery that cruises along so smoothly, and so quickly, you've got to pay attention. That's because Bridges' towering performance may divert your eye from the keen details.",The Big Lebowski
Alison Gillmor,"The Big Lebowski doesn't have [Fargo's] wholeness, but it does have absolutely perfect moments -- quirky details, darkly funny dialogue, indelible small parts.",The Big Lebowski

Eleanor Ringel Cater,"The Big Lebowski is probably the worst movie the Coen brothers have ever made. Which, given their track record and the other movies out there, doesn't necessarily mean it's all that bad. Still, ""Lebowski"" is something of a letdown.",The Big Lebowski
Donald Munro,"Make no mistake: If Fargo came this close to machining out your weird-o-meter, The Big Lebowski will probably nudge you over the edge, then stand back and laugh as you splatter on the rocks below.",The Big Lebowski
Steve Persall,The most original and blithely astonishing comedy to blaze across the screen since Raising Arizona.,The Big Lebowski
Wallace Baine,"The burden of being Hollywood's hippest filmmakers looks to be weighing heavily on the Coen brothers. After Fargo, ""Lebowski"" is a return to the overly manner film-nerd humor of The Hudsucker Proxy.",The Big Lebowski
Carrie Rickey,"It is a funny picture, in both the ha-ha and peculiar senses. And if it is not as fully fledged as Raising Arizona and Fargo, this is because the Coen Brothers set such high standards for their edgy comedies.",The Big Lebowski

Jeff Beck,Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal stands as one of the writer/director's greatest triumphs thanks to its exploration of intriguing themes that are woven into a tapestry of fascinating & compelling characters,The Seventh Seal
John Beaufort,Mr. Bergman’s objective in The Seventh Seal has been to achieve with the camera the simplicity and directness of a medieval muralist in recounting an immemorial mystery drama which touches the great issues of human experience.,The Seventh Seal
Dilys Powell,"The magnificent craftsmanship, of course, I admit. But beneath the surface of the high-class, bony morality which has understandably attracted so much admiration there lurks what to me is a dreadful squashy sentimentality.",The Seventh Seal
Jonas Mekas,"Obsessed with the ideas of love, life, death, good and evil, [Bergman] mediates as he goes, taking in symbols, in parables and images that are often of breathtaking beauty.",The Seventh Seal

Kevin A. Ranson,... questions the silence of God and service unto Him... (life) choices are shown to be one's own without passing judgment... this is the personification all other cinematic reapers are measured against.,The Seventh Seal
Robin Holabird,"The film proved revolutionary, telling a compelling story while seeking answers to life's biggest questions.",The Seventh Seal

Rachel Wagner,I loved the black and white cinematography and the creative choices.,The Seventh Seal
Sarah Cartland,I was worried memories of Death playing games with Bill and Ted would sour my first watch. Luckily this cinematic tour de force has the physical beauty and philosophical heft to rise above such trivial pursuits (see what I did there). Darkly funny.,The Seventh Seal

Emiliano Basile,... Incredibly interesting because of the way it's told. [Full review in Spanish],Room
Keith Garlington,There is an underlying hope to “Room” that is even present during the most grim moments.,Room
Brian Eggert,"Room never grandstands to overstated dramatic revelations or unrealistic catharsis; it tells an affecting story through the three-dimensional emotions of its characters, but not by spelling out each emotion through expositional dialogue.",Room
Hosea Rupprecht,Room showcases the best and worst of humanity in a compelling story adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel.,Room
Richard Crouse,"A tearjerker that occasionally makes too much room for melodrama and on-the-money dialogue, but is captivatingly told nonetheless.",Room
Joanne Laurier,Room is too vague and noncommittal ... about its aims to do much more than cash in on its idiosyncrasies as an abduction melodrama-thriller.,Room
Wesley Lovell,"Brie Larson is at her vulnerable best in this exploration of isolation, identity, and perceived safety set around a young woman and her son held captive by her rapist.",Room
Mike Massie,The focus on the aftermath starts to dilute the potency of the initial premise and its hair-raising unraveling.,Room
Nicholas Bell,"Though Tremblay is ultimately a tad too old for the role and the emotional manipulation is a bit too heavy-handed, Room is a solid motion picture.",Room

Joseph Garcia,I love how the film transcended the superhero genre to become a tragic western. The most emotional superhero film ever made.,Logan
Keith Garlington,"There are no punchy jokes or one-liners. There are no colorful, larger than life characters. Mangold’s tone remains intensely serious and his characters are broken and struggling.",Logan
Brian Eggert,"An uncommon comic book film that transcends its label, Logan engages through its harmony of post-modernism and serious treatment of complex characters.",Logan

Kip Mooney,Logan is confident enough to mark the end of the road and know it's said all it needed to say.,Logan
Nathan Mattise,Logan took a hero long familiar to film-goers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a Western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process.,Logan
Jim Rohner,Logan as a black sheep that future audiences will wonder what factors ever allowed it to be made. You can appreciate it being the pariah of Marvel's superhero output too ...,Logan
Mark Cassidy,"Logan presents us with a dark, devastating final journey for one of cinema's most enduring comic book characters. Though it is undoubtedly bleak, there are also moments of much-needed warmth, and ultimately a sense of hope resonates.",Logan
Jordy Sirkin,"It's raw, emotional and brutal - and a beautiful final film for Wolverine.",Logan

Jennifer Bisset,"[It] wound gripping tension into the unglamorous legwork of journalists, played by a perfectly-balanced ensemble including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams.",Spotlight

Joanne Laurier,One of the film's strengths is that it shows the Catholic hierarchy as an essential component of Boston's political and social superstructure.,Spotlight

Mark Jackson,"A syllogism: A) The Communist agenda put 1,100 men into the Catholic church to destroy it from within. B) The destruction was due to rampant pedophilia. C) Therefore, the 1,100 men were chosen because they were pedophiles. ""Spotlight"" shows why.",Spotlight

Mark Steyn,"Remarkably, the director Terry George and his co-writer Keir Pearson have pulled it off, rooting the big picture of anonymous murder in one small precise close-up.",Hotel Rwanda
Nick Rogers,"Like ""Schindler's List,"" ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows how the madness of genocide and war converted one man's context of wealth and success from capitalism to humanitarianism. Don Cheadle honors Paul Rusesabagina by tapping his brave face and internal rage.",Hotel Rwanda

Dan Jardine,The filmmakers want to respect history and not exploit it as so much slasher movie fodder.,Hotel Rwanda
Mark Perry,"Cheadle is outstanding in his first major lead role, one where he is present during practically every important moment in this story.",Hotel Rwanda
Unknown reviewer,"There's a tidiness and sense of convenience in the film's stock characterisations and button-pushing plotting that detracts from its impact. The film doesn't just contrive to contain the slaughter, but also its own anger.",Hotel Rwanda
Dan Jolin,"Who cares about overdone orchestral blasts or signpost-waving lines of dialogue when such raw, naked, painful humanity is displayed by Don Cheadle in the central role?",Hotel Rwanda
Philippa Hawker,Cheadle has an Oscar nomination for best actor. But this isn't a grandstanding portrayal: it is a performance at the service of the work.,Hotel Rwanda
James Wegg,"In 2004, with Darfur burning and Congo smouldering, has anything really changed?",Hotel Rwanda
Scott Tobias,"Showing traces of the well-meaning paternalism that dogs many Western films about Africa, Hotel Rwanda doesn't go far enough in indicting Europeans and Americans for protecting their own while failing to intervene in time to stop the mass killings.",Hotel Rwanda
Jeremy C. Fox,"Cheadle has been doing great, often hilariously comic, work in supporting roles for years; Hotel Rwanda is his first lead role, but it likely won't be his last.",Hotel Rwanda

Mark Johnson,One of the most visceral and authentic war films ever made.,Platoon
Matt Brunson,Platoon may not be the best Vietnam war film ever made -- I still prefer both Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket by a healthy margin -- but I wouldn't care to argue with any veteran who states that it's the most honest depiction of that insane skirmish.,Platoon
Rob Gonsalves,"In terms of the day-to-day madness of combat, Stone’s vision is horrifyingly realistic, the reportage of someone who was there.",Platoon
David Denby,This is a great American movie -- easily the most powerful film of the year.,Platoon
Marsha McCreadie,"I didn't take a single note during the screening of Platoon: It's that engrossing, that overwhelming.",Platoon
Eleanor O'Sullivan,"It is a terrifying movie, one that will shatter illusions. But that is the heart of Stone's message.",Platoon
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"It's a powerful, painful, must-see film -- an impassioned and riveting dispatch from the front that's at once a battle cry and a lamentation.",Platoon
Patrick Taggart,"There's no self-conscious artistry here, no metaphorical trips up a river into a thickening jungle. Platoon is a clean, direct narrative that may not go to the heart of darkness but does get to the heart of the matter.",Platoon
Stephen Hunter,"Exactly as the war it chronicles was conceptually flawed by the chronic problem of fighting 1967's battles by 1944's tactics, so is Platoon flawed by its decision to make 1987's movie by 1957's structure.",Platoon
JoAnn Rhetts,"Extravagantly well acted and passionately directed, it is not a pretty picture. But it may well prove a healing one for Americans who were there or who are beginning to understand and accept the particular heroics of the 27 million Vietnam veterans.",Platoon
Diane Haithman,"Despite the effectiveness of some of its moments, one begins to wish this movie were headed somewhere. Sensitive, intimate performances on the part of every member of a large ensemble cast, however, are enough to keep one watching.",Platoon
Michael H. Price,Platoon marks the channeling of a zealot's rant into artistry of a high caliber.,Platoon
John Powers,"Platoon comes closer than the other Vietnam movies to telling the necessary truths of Vietnam, to capturing the camaraderie and suspicion, the indignities and barbarities experienced by the soldiers who fought and died in that dirty big war.",Platoon
Jeff Strickler,"This is not a John Wayne war in which glory awaits the gung-ho crusader. There are no heroes, only survivors... The tension of instant death that Stone imparts in his script is accented by the taut camera work of cinematographer Robert Richardson.",Platoon
Bill Morrison,"The time for this film is now. And it deserves comparison with such great anti-war movies as All Quiet on the Western Front, Paths of Glory and Grand Illusion.",Platoon
Mike McGrady,"Platoon is brutal, vicious, surpassingly ugly -- in a word, realistic. It’s one of those movies that are hard to watch yet, impossible not to watch.",Platoon
Marylynn Uricchio,"Outstanding performances, particularly by Berenger and Dafoe, bring the war home in an unforgettable manner.",Platoon
Jack Garner,Platoon has the honesty and passion of a work that can only have sprung from experience -- and from the creator's needs to exercise the horrors of the past.,Platoon
George Williams,"[Platoon] looks like the real thing, feels like the real thing, sounds like the real thing. And the actors... have been ingeniously chosen for their roles -- they are so right.",Platoon
Terry Orme,Platoon is a tough and honest film that looks at Vietnam with eyes open wide and with the clear head that such a subject requires. It tells an utterly absorbing story and it delivers a moral as well.,Platoon

Josh Larsen,"Those nightmares we've all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation.",The Terminator
Jason Bailey,"Much of Terminator's greatness is due to its low-budget aesthetic and lo-fi energy; perhaps out of necessity, Cameron's sense of storytelling has a lean efficiency that both he and the series have long since abandoned.",The Terminator
Hank Gallo,"You almost forget the film's flaws - like the cartoony look of the war-ravaged future. Here, the most absurd excursion is believable and we go along willingly - stopping now and then for a breath or a laugh.",The Terminator
Kirk Ellis,The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.,The Terminator

Star Staff,"The showing of close-ups is used as a means of unfolding the tale, which depicts the last six hours of Joan's life, her trial and death. The lack of story and essential support leaves most of the work to Mlle. Falconetti, and she handles it admirably.",The Passion of Joan of Arc
Steven Prokopy,The Passion of Joan of Arc is nothing without that face. Falconetti's features are both youthful and weathered; her expressions are tortured but joyous. It's a spectacular performance.,The Passion of Joan of Arc

Tim Brayton,The consummate work of cinema.,The Passion of Joan of Arc
Harry Alan Potamkin,"[Jeanne d'Arc] is an historical film, but not a costume film; an historical film that is contemporaneous in its universal references. [It] is a religious film, but not a sanctimonious film. Life, it urges, is transcendent. It is a transcendent film.",The Passion of Joan of Arc

James Croot,"This would all be dreary and forgettable fluff, were it not for the charm and chemistry of the leads.",Before Sunset
Tina Kakadelis,Before Sunset is the kind of movie that takes every pre-conceived notion of filmmaking and throws it out the window. It is a celebration of being alive and how lovely and frightening love is.,Before Sunset
Keith Garlington,"The conversations flow naturally – at first as if getting to know each other again, then later like two soulmates pouring their hearts out – and we never doubt that there is a real connection between these two characters.",Before Sunset
David Walsh,"One of the difficulties is that the film makes no distinction between the inevitable, natural processes of aging and change and the ways in which people are worn down by man-made circumstances.",Before Sunset
Nicholas Bell,"This middle segment ends up being the least invigorating... Before Sunset feels a bit less substantial. Jesse and Celine play less easily off one another, their interactions clouded by adulthood, responsibility, etc.",Before Sunset

David Nusair,...a superior sequel that accomplishes everything that one might've hoped...,Before Sunset
Tim Brayton,A stone-cold masterpiece.,Before Sunset
Christy Lemire,"It's a lovely, beguiling little film a rare treat during this overheated season of blockbusters. It's also an unusual example of a follow-up that doesn't seem forced, but expands effortlessly on the original.",Before Sunset
Joe Morgenstern,"The reunion has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, married life and sex.",Before Sunset
Scott Tobias,"Shooting in long takes, Linklater and his actors (who get co-screenwriting credit) allow the conversation to curlicue effortlessly from literate banter to matters of the heart, and sometimes to places in between.",Before Sunset
Nell Minow,"Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults.",Before Sunset
Nick Rogers,"As a romance streaked with regrets, obligations and fears, ""Sunset"" builds to a wistful, perfect conclusion - a fadeout infused with the idea that a memory's never finished as long as you're alive and one of the loveliest last-line exchanges of all time.",Before Sunset

Kevin Thomas,"As for Kassovitz, his own go-for-broke visual bravura and highly charged storytelling are so American in feel that the news that he plans his Hollywood seems inevitable.",La haine
Alan Morrison,"Stark, exquisite black-and-white photography drains what little cheer there is out of the concrete jungle, creating an alien cityscape devoid of sunshine. But Mathieu Kassovitz's triumph is in finding humanity in every single one of his characters.",La haine
Philip French,Two things save La Haine from being schematic or a mere slice of life. The first is the quality of the performances... The second is the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz's script and direction.,La haine
Caryn James,"The kind of strong but narrowly focused work that might have had problems in translation. Yet for American viewers, the eeriest part of Mr. Kassovitz's precise and troubling film is how easily it reflects our own social problems.",La haine
Hal Hinson,"Hate, the brilliant, abrasive new film from French writer-director Mathieu Kassovitz, is all muscle and rage. From the opening shot, it punishes us with the intensity of its explosive black-and-white images.",La haine
Roger Ebert,"Hate is, I suppose, a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies. In America, we cling to the notion that we have choice... In France, Kassovitz says, it is society that has made the choice.",La haine
Lisa Schwarzbaum,"The result is a jittery, propulsive, slangy study of jeunes hommes in the hood, complete with a soundtrack of reggae and rap.",La haine
Derek Malcolm,"The strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it's boring, and they despise the society that's created it for them.",La haine

Rene Rodriguez,"What you remember most about Hate isn't its technique, but its powerhouse emotional punch: It's a stunner.",La haine

Geoff Brown,"For anyone grown weary of French cinema's bourgeois sheen, La Haine is a wonderful wake-up call. See it.",La haine
Peter Keough,"Although occasionally stunning in its stylistic audacity, abrupt brutality, and inspired moments of absurdity, La Haine is kid stuff compared to its American counterparts, a tourist guide to the mean streets.",La haine
David Denby,"The movie is powerful but irritatingly vague and fatalistic. One gets the impression that for Kassovitz, hopelessness is somehow more pure and beautiful than ambition or even the desire to survive.",La haine
Ed Masley,"Hate is a grim, unsettling film with plenty to say and a fresh way of saying it.",La haine
Jay Carr,"Hate isn't perfect, but it's got all the right energies and feelings and is miles beyond Kassovitz's first film, Cafe au Lait, in its power, immediately, and moral authority.",La haine
Carrie Rickey,"Rash as adolescence and urgent as its terse title, Hate is a total immersion in race and class war as played out over 24 hours in a Paris housing project.",La haine
Jack Mathews,"A powerful piece of sociopolitical filmmaking, and Kassovitz has established himself as the leading voice of the new consciousness in French film.",La haine

Keith Garlington,"It maintains a wonderful period feel thanks to Julian Day’s costumes and Katie Spencer’s set design. Laurie Rose’s stellar cinematography vividly captures the beautiful sun-soaked Monte Carlo as well as the gloomy, atmospheric Mandeley.",Rebecca
Victoria Luxford,"Ben Wheatleys Rebecca really fails to distinguish itself, ending up another by-the-numbers remake to be lost in streaming queues.",Rebecca
David Gonzalez,"While Rebecca will certainly not remove the sentiment from cinephiles wondering why a new remake was necessary, Wheatleys take surpasses the quality of the Psycho and Rear Window remakes.",Rebecca
Brian Eggert,"Not only fails to live up to Hitchcocks classic, but it eschews much of the Gothic mood and atmosphere that distinguished the original book and film.",Rebecca
Jason Shawhan,"So here's the truth: This isn't as good as the Hitchcock film. But that Rebecca isn't currently streaming anywhere, so my advice is to check out this take, and then seek out the original for a juicy contrast.",Rebecca
Audrey Fox,"It's a shame that in adapting a piece of work with such ominous power, Ben Wheatley could strip it of all its psychological intensity and create a version of Rebecca so puzzlingly flat.",Rebecca
Milana Vujkov,"[Deconstructing] marriage, and the British class system, through rendering a classic, yet deeply subversive tale of passion, bondage, illness and jealousy entirely soulless.",Rebecca
Matt Lynch,[Rebecca is] a complete bastardization of the characters and themes in one of literature's great gothic romances.,Rebecca
Jozie Konczal,"With these improvements to the characters, why then did I enjoy the film so much less than I enjoyed Hitchcock's? Why did I view Maxim as less appealing?",Rebecca
Sarah Ward,"As the feature's heroine herself learns, sumptuous packaging alone is rarely ever truly and completely satisfying.",Rebecca
Cassidy Olsen,"This new Rebecca, helmed by Ben Wheatley, is but an imitation of what Hollywood glamour and greatness looked like in 1940, produced by a studio that's in the midst of a long-term project to zombify that era.",Rebecca
Eric Marchen,Not since Gus Van Sant's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho has a remake of a classic movie been more redundant.,Rebecca
Mark Meszoros,"This Rebecca is a worthwhile blend of old and new, and it should be enough to tempt you to go to Manderley again.",Rebecca
David Walsh,"The creators ... have drawn the story closer to themselves in various ways, and made it more acceptable, and, as a result, left it mostly without edge, rather bland.",Rebecca
Sean Axmaker,Brad Bird’s cartoon fable in science fiction clothing and fairy tale trappings is a delightful throwback to the classic era of hand-drawn animated movies and delivers the most amazing little boy wish fulfillment fantasies.,The Iron Giant
Leigh Paatsch,The characters are far more complex than most animated fare.,The Iron Giant
Mike Massie,"Fuses Cold War paranoia with a science-fiction/horror B-movie template to create an entertaining, action-filled, and clearly disclosed parable.",The Iron Giant
Drew Dietsch,...an incredible achievement in both narrative and animation.,The Iron Giant
Kathi Maio,"I found The Iron Giant to be a completely engaging movie experience. I laughed. And, yes, I cried, too. Moreover, I felt like I'd really gotten my money's worth when I left the theater after watching it.",The Iron Giant
Armond White,"The Iron Giant should have been immediately recognized as a near-perfect, classical expression of imagination, combining childlike wonder and adult sophistication.",The Iron Giant
Leona Laurie,Robot Lessons Learned: - How many movies are just Short Circuit? - We understand why Hogarth doesn't have friends. - Vin Diesel's voice acting niche....,The Iron Giant
Miles Surrey,"This is, full stop, one of the best animated movies of all time; an enduring classic.",The Iron Giant
Rachel Wagner,It is beautiful and moving and the animation is gorgeous.,The Iron Giant
Adam Nayman,"The Iron Giant captures and crystallizes its source material's anxious, humane spirit. It might be the most empathetic and exhilarating mainstream American animated feature ever made.",The Iron Giant
Dorothy Woodend,"It doesn't try to hide its own cleverness, it's funny and pulls in references from all over the place, from Bambi to Frankenstein.",The Iron Giant
Kate Muir,"Tender, moving and exciting for kids (and their secretly tearful parents).",The Iron Giant
Peter Bradshaw,"Watching this again 17 years after its original release, I savoured again the resemblances to Spielberg, Wilde and Brian Forbes's Whistle Down the Wind.",The Iron Giant
Tim Brayton,"In every way, one of the highlights of both animation and family-friendly cinema in the last quarter-century.",The Iron Giant
Jeff Strickler,"While youngsters will enjoy the film on one level, it reaches out to adults on a completely different plane. They will see an allegory about power and politics and the danger of allowing either to run roughshod over humanity.",The Iron Giant
David Ansen,"This is not exactly standard children's fare, but kids (and their parents) should be smitten by its wit and wisdom.",The Iron Giant
Matt Soergel,"This is sharp, sophisticated stuff, appreciated on different levels by both parents and children, and even those who are neither. The film has impish humor, great adventure and more than a few thrills.",The Iron Giant
Dennis King,"Wisely, Bird and company eschew the standard Disney formula of catchy show tunes and cuddly animal sidekicks and lead Warner Bros. toward an animation style the studio can call its own.",The Iron Giant
Peter Keough,A magical evocation of a special time in history and a time in everybody's life when the dream and the nightmare quotients are equally high.,The Iron Giant
F.X. Feeney,The Iron Giant's theme of fear of the unknown is craftily balanced against the power of innocent imagination.,The Iron Giant
Sean Axmaker,There’s more than a bit of Christ allegory in the imagery but it’s the character of the scruffy prisoners in the impoverished prison... that gives the film its juice.,Cool Hand Luke
Matt Brunson,"In a career filled with iconic anti-heroes -- including what I deem the “4-H Club” from the 1960s (Hud, Harper, Hombre, and The Hustler) -- Lucas Jackson just might be the most popular of all the societal misfits played by Paul Newman.",Cool Hand Luke
Douglas Davidson,"Between the thoughtfulness of the narrative and both Newman’s and Kennedy’s performances (for which the latter won an Oscar), one can see why the film is as beloved as it is 56 years later.",Cool Hand Luke
Danielle Solzman,Cool Hand Luke harkens back to an earlier era in Warner Bros. when they made gangster and chain gang films but this one is elevated by the likes of Paul Newman and George Kennedy.,Cool Hand Luke
Tom Meek,"In my mind, the most defining role of Paul Newman's long, illustrious career, and one of the great antihero films told with cruel wit - a black comedy if ever there was one.",Cool Hand Luke
John Mahoney,"Well written by Pearce and Pierson and acted by a most talented ensemble of performers, Luke succeeds as both a highly humorous and deeply dramatic study of the immolation of human spirit in captivity and as an allegory.",Cool Hand Luke
Mike Massie,"An archetype of '60s counterculture in cinema, particularly with its nuanced messages of discontent, conspicuous humor, and the unforgettable performance by Paul Newman.",Cool Hand Luke
Wilfrid Sheed,The movie cheats slightly by hinting Newman's death is a triumph - as if all crucifixions were alike. But this is a very small carp at a very fine movie.,Cool Hand Luke
Jake Wilson,"The whole thing depends on Newman's blue eyes, easy grin, and ability to appear charismatic but never cocky.",Cool Hand Luke
Brian Gibson,"As this 'Southern' turns up the heat, the sense of sadistic oppression, of being looked down on by 'the man,' swelters and burns. The glowering sun eclipses the convict in its hellfire glow. Newman/Luke's knowing smile, though, burns on.",Cool Hand Luke
Felix Vasquez Jr.,An incredible film...,Cool Hand Luke
Unknown reviewer,It's easy to forget just how fine Cool Hand Luke is.,Cool Hand Luke
Josh Larsen,"...a gulag melodrama, if such a thing is possible.",Cool Hand Luke
Robert Levin,,Cool Hand Luke
Dave Kehr,"Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a horror, but the cast teems with so many familiar faces that this 1967 film can't help but entertain.",Cool Hand Luke
David Nusair,Anchored by Paul Newman's thoroughly magnetic performance...,Cool Hand Luke
Bill Weber,"Newman remains watchable and glamorous throughout, bloody, muddy or coated in torso-flattering sweat, but the film's efforts to sentimentally ""humanize"" him by psychological revelation are clumsy.",Cool Hand Luke
Chris Cabin,The lines and the character have survived the film's oft-forgotten actual message.,Cool Hand Luke
Jeffrey M. Anderson,Cool Hand Luke now seems more like a well-made entertainment than any kind of American masterpiece.,Cool Hand Luke
John J. Puccio,...most viewers will have little failure understanding the movie and its motives. They communicate brilliantly.,Cool Hand Luke
Wesley Lovell,"As a piece of entertainment, it works. As a historical document, its contents are too sanitized in an effort to avoid inflaming old tensions and that mutes its impact.",The Help
Nadia Dalimonte,"While the narrative includes Black characters’ perspectives, the writing holds them at a distance, not providing more in-depth character development overall.",The Help
Brian Eggert,"This is a film that will expose you to horrible truths about a not-too-distant past and, in the end, makes you laugh and feel like there’s a happy ending, except there isn’t one. Not really.",The Help
Cory Woodroof,"The Help, a likely Best Picture nominee, has one of the best ensembles of the year.",The Help
Mark Jackson,"""The Help"" will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate how far we've come as a society, how much has radically changed since the 1960s and, given our current racial climate, reflect on how much more progress we need.",The Help
Jack Fleischer,"This movie is slick and mainstream; it's also funny and sweet, dramatic and pointed.",The Help
Mike Massie,"An uplifting, feel-good movie.",The Help
Richard Propes,The Help works beautifully as an entertaining film about a troubling period in American history and the people who were impacted by it.,The Help
Katie Smith-Wong,"Abruptly ending and slightly overlong it may be, the performances from the three female leads and the authenticity of the setting covers the cracks in an otherwise charming film.",The Help
Debbie Lynn Elias,"As perfect as a sipping a cold glass of sweet tea on a sweltering summer afternoon, TheHelp quenches your thirst for a perfect movie experience.",The Help
Leslie Combemale,It's beautiful to both look at and watch.,The Help
Mattie Lucas,"A fun, satisfying and often quite moving summer movie for grown-ups.",The Help
Micheal Compton,"Wants to have a say about some serious subjects while at the same time appealing to the masses. To its credit, The Help succeeds more on the latter than it does the former, leaving a somewhat effective drama that could have been much more.",The Help
Shubhra Gupta,"Yes it has drawn some criticism for not being authentic enough in depicting the painful disparity, but in putting rarely heard voices on screen and telling it in a story as regonisable as this, The Help deserves only praise.",The Help
Amie Simon,"The Help succeeds is because even though there are triumphs, they're not easy-and the spectacularly strong cast takes it to the level it needs to be at so it's believable and not cheesy.",The Help
Kelly Jane Torrance,"There's a luscious attention to paid to period detail, with brightly colored frocks and subdued homes. Yet the film itself is rather black and white, keeping it from being an unalloyed artistic success.",The Help
Joseph Walsh,"The film has its moments of twee sentimentalism, but also resonates with a clear sense of poignancy, and is told in an accessible and hugely pleasurable way.",The Help
Anna Smith,"The Help is a somewhat light-hearted take on the relations between black maids and their bosses in 1960s Mississippi, giving a simplified yet well-intended story of Kathryn Stockettâ€™s novel for the big screen.",The Help
Brandy McDonnell,"""The Help"" still serves as an uplifting reminder of how compassion, courage, empathy and honesty have helped change the world.",The Help
Megan Basham,It resonates with our desire to see wrongs set right at a time when so many white Americans were shamefully working against liberty and justice.,The Help
Kevin Maher,"The grandaddy of all rom-coms is this ingenious, fabulously smutty and still relevant 90-year-old two-hander.",It Happened One Night
Otis Ferguson,"Considering its subject, it is better than it has any right to be -- better acted, better directed, better written.",It Happened One Night
Mark Johnson,"Satisfying and romantic, the chemistry between Gable and Colbert is unmatched.",It Happened One Night
Danielle Solzman,...It Happened One Night remains one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made.,It Happened One Night
Pauline Kael,"The two stars interact with easy, on-the-button timing; Gable has a gift for seeming virile even at his most foolish, and when things go wrong Colbert manages to look starry-eyed and blankly depressed at the same time.",It Happened One Night
Victor Pineyro,"The acting provides deceit, romance and comedy in a grandiose way. But it's inevitable to feel that time has gone by and through It Happened One Night's narrative efforts. [Full review in Spanish]",It Happened One Night
Brian Eggert,"After nearly a century of critics, scholars, and moviegoers singing its praises, the answer to what makes the film endure remains simple, if rather dissatisfying: Movie Magic.",It Happened One Night
Walter Ramsey,"Boy, howdy, this is one that you cannot afford to miss.",It Happened One Night
Reg Whitley,"I have not enjoyed a film so much for a long time as I did It Happened One Night, a really delightful comedy-drama featuring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable.",It Happened One Night
"T.D. Kemp, Jr.","Once in a great while, Hollywood outdoes itself and produces a motion picture that establishes a new high mark in genuine entertainment. Such a picture is It Happened One Night.",It Happened One Night
NZ Herald Staff,"Skilful direction by Frank Capra, brilliant acting by Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, crisp dialogue and an exciting plot make It Happened One Night... one of the most entertaining films oi the year.",It Happened One Night
John Betjeman,"It Happened One Night is one of the most entertaining films I have seen. Its entertainment value is entirely due to good acting and good directing, particularly to the latter.",It Happened One Night
Matt Neal,"The quintessential pre-Code rom-com, laying out the template for a formula that exists to this day.",It Happened One Night
Eleanor Barnes,"It Happened One Night is a sparkling, amusing, clean and thoroughly delightful Columbia picture which this writer would enjoy seeing a second time.",It Happened One Night
James T. Hamada,"It makes no difference where you see it, just so long as you see it. But if I were you, I'd see it now. And you've got to see it, for it's straight, genuine fun.",It Happened One Night
Mae Tinee,"The co-stars are a refreshing team with their good looks, bonhomie, and talent.",It Happened One Night
C.A. Lejeune,It is my broad opinion as a motion picture fan that It Happened One Night is one of the most entertaining films that has ever been offered to the public.,It Happened One Night
Harold V. Cohen,There is a growing conviction in this corner that Mr. Frank Capra is by far Hollywood's most reliable director.,It Happened One Night
Jack Moffitt,Their misadventures are so hilarious that audiences give themselves up to one long spasm of laughter from the first shot to the last but behind all the hilarity there is tenderness and sympathy.,It Happened One Night
Mildred Martin,The surprise in this film is the discovery of Clark Gable as a comedian of considerable charm and ability.,It Happened One Night
Serena Seghedoni,"The original Aladdin had many flaws, but it was [...] full of heart. And, while Guy Ritchie's live action movie might be a better film in terms of special effects, dance routines and perhaps even structure, ""heart"" is exactly what it doesn't have.",Aladdin
Manuel São Bento,"Guy Ritchie proves he’s a fantastic director, by delivering some beautiful one-take sequences, and exceptionally fun, well-choreographed musical numbers. Technically, the production and set design are astounding.",Aladdin
Cory Woodroof,It plays like the most expensive Disney Channel Original Movie of all time; it’s not as cinematic as it is ready to stream.,Aladdin
Kate Boyle,"Overall, a decent attempt at remaking a treasured animated classic.",Aladdin
Swara Salih,Aladdin works when it focuses on its characters. The world it builds is nice and lavish but without authentic depth. That combined with the lack of wonder and mystery keeps this from being as revolutionary as it would have liked to be.,Aladdin
Eddie Harrison,…every element here is a pitiful downgrade on the original…,Aladdin
M.N. Miller,"While Smith and Massoud do display some buddy chemistry, it’s Naomi Scott’s fierce performance as Jasmine that’s the real showstopper.",Aladdin
Brian Eggert,The characters of Ritchie's film feel like they're trying to replicate better performances than they could ever hope to achieve.,Aladdin
David Gonzalez,"Aladdin does not try to reinvent the wheel, but it made sure it didnt break it. The film is a welcomed addition to the Disney live-action library.",Aladdin
Lonita Cook,Let me tell you: Will Smith is back.,Aladdin
Hosea Rupprecht,"Aladdin is as fun as a magic carpet ride, so sit back and enjoy the unbelievable sights and indescribable feeling...",Aladdin
Michael J. Casey,A movie loaded with missed opportunities.,Aladdin
Alex Bentley,"It's unlikely that the new Aladdin will be the cultural touchstone that the original was, but it has plenty of memorable moments that complement well the iconic ones many of us hold near and dear.",Aladdin
Jesse Hassenger,"Still, as cynical and pointless an operation as this remake cycle has often been, Aladdin is a bit livelier than the equivalent Beauty and the Beast.",Aladdin
Richard Crouse,"Despite the updates and the pomp Aladdin feels underwhelming by the time the end credits roll. The songs frequently interrupt the flow of the story, creating a stop-and-go feel that sucks some of the film's momentum away.",Aladdin
Candice McMillan,"When the sand settles, Aladdin is more fun than needs fixing.",Aladdin
Joey Morona,The movie addresses the problematic aspects of the original to make it more modern and relatable.,Aladdin
Mike Massie,A fully computer-animated Abu is the first of many changes that furnish a hint of phoniness in a world that now demands a greater suspension of disbelief.,Aladdin
Charles Koplinski,"Visually, this is a stunning feat along with incredible action stunts and choreography.",Aladdin
Andrew Gaudion,"Aladdin is much like its protagonist; flawed, a little clumsy, but ultimately quite winning; a diamond in the rough.",Aladdin
Mark Johnson,An exquisitely shot Western epic with majestic landscapes detailing the crimes against indigenous people and the final years of the American West.,Dances with Wolves
Bruce R. Miller,"Dances With Wolves is Costner's crossroads. Amazingly, he emerges from it a better actor and an extremely good director.",Dances with Wolves
Stephen Hunter,"How much easier if the movie were crummy and could be dismissed. But, damn its smarmy soul, it's beautifully watchable, a return to the visual vernacular of the western epic and all its old-fashioned scenic values.",Dances with Wolves
Tom Gearhart,"Magnificent. It's the only word to describe Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves. An epic in the grand tradition, it is a movie of breathtaking sweep and noble aims, and the story it tells is at once stirring and heartfelt.",Dances with Wolves
Pauline Kael,"This epic was made by a bland megalomaniac (The Indians should have named him ""Plays with Camera""). You look at that untroubled face and know he can make everything lightweight.",Dances with Wolves
David Elliott,"[Kevin Costner] is winning too much puff press for ""risking"" his stardom. Washed in John Barry's symphonic syrup (close your eyes and you see Out of Africa), the film basks in the comfy, 1-2-3 storytelling that once ruled Hollywood.",Dances with Wolves
Dann Gire,"At times, Dances with Wolves comes dangerously close to becoming a stodgy historical drama. And yet, deftly inserted humor and strategically placed heart-tugs keep Dances with Wolves in step. It's a bravura piece of [David] Lean filmmaking.",Dances with Wolves
Bob Thomas,"Even with its flaws, Dances With Wolves is cause for celebration, a haunting elegy to the end of the Great Plains wilderness.",Dances with Wolves
Bob Fenster,It's difficult for any actor to direct himself effectively. It's amazing when someone does it in an epic that turns out as fine as this tale of the Old West.,Dances with Wolves
Eleanor O'Sullivan,Dances with Wolves is a flawed but stunning film and a remarkable debut for first-time director Costner.,Dances with Wolves
Eleanor Ringel Cater,"Dances With Wolves is an audacious personal film, done big and done right. Somewhere John Ford must be nodding his approval.",Dances with Wolves
Michael MacCambridge,"Costner, always an underrated, charismatic actor, deserves his due: He set out to make a movie about an America long gone and American wounds too long forgotten. He has succeeded, grandly and gracefully.",Dances with Wolves
Lawrence Toppman,"The story has comfortable familiarity, like a once-heard fairy tale unfolding as we expect and desire. Yet Costner's direction makes it fresh.",Dances with Wolves
Kathy Huffhines,"Beginning with [a] kind of comically earnest freshness, Dances with Wolves stretches into an engaging, noble, epic vision worthy of filling a screen so wide it seems to literally sweep from sea to shining sea.",Dances with Wolves
Art Chapman,It is a personal story played out in a wide-open setting. It has stunning action (especially a breathtaking buffalo hunt) and moments of serenity. But the one thing that sets this frontier story apart from the norm is its dignity.,Dances with Wolves
Kathey Clarey,"Dances With Wolves is the first truly great film of the decade, the kind of film that will stand the test of time. It stirs the senses in both its beauty and brutality.",Dances with Wolves
Malcolm Johnson,"Whatever its flaws, however, this is a grand and caring film that every lover of the medium should see. It is admirable for many reasons including the madness of its conception and execution.",Dances with Wolves
Robert W. Butler,"The cynic in everyone wants to dig in its heels and stubbornly resist. But on a purely emotional level, Costner’s directing debut is extremely satisfying.",Dances with Wolves
Helen Knode,"Dances With Wolves takes a politically adventurous stance without being preachy, and packs a tremendous emotional punch besides.",Dances with Wolves
Michael D. Reid,"Dances with Wolves is a near-miraculous achievement on several fronts. Working from a screenplay by Michael Blake based on his book, Costner shows himself to be a masterful director who is equally at home behind and in front of the camera.",Dances with Wolves
Kevin Maher,"The panoramic vistas from the cinematographer Robby Müller are as breathtaking as any John Ford western, while the naturalistic performances and deft narrative structure make this the strongest movie in the career of its director, Wim Wenders.","Paris, Texas"
Brian Eggert,"It transcends [Wenders'] usual road movie archetypes and pressing alienation, and it enters the realm of an almost mythic quest for healing and reconciliation after the emotional fallout of masculine violence.","Paris, Texas"
Keith Garlington,"Most of the performances hit every right note especially Stanton, Kinski, and young Carson. All of this is brought together under the management of Wenders who tells a living, breathing story free of contrivances and artifice.","Paris, Texas"
Peter Bradshaw,"... An eerie, sad story whose meaning disappears over the vast horizon as if on a highway heading away through the desert.","Paris, Texas"
Joe Pollack,"It's a striking, gripping film for most of its length, with Wenders and cinematographer Robby Muller showing a great love of and fascination for the land -- almost as if their European upbringings had made them slightly envious of the wide-open spaces.","Paris, Texas"
Desmond Ryan,"It is clear-eyed and unsparing, and full of the price our way of life extracts from those who can least afford it emotionally.","Paris, Texas"
Malcolm Johnson,A rare and fascinating experience for those patient enough to go with its slow flow.,"Paris, Texas"
Marsha McCreadie,"The movie belongs to Stanton, of course, and it's hard to think of any other actor who can go from Chaplinlike outcast to tragic hero in the space of a feature film.","Paris, Texas"
Barbara Shulgasser,All kinds of allegorical meaning could be read into this movie by any analyst determined and supercilious enough. It wouldn't be worth the trouble. The film is far too full of itself as it is.,"Paris, Texas"
Bill Cosford,It would be worth seeing for Stanton's performance alone.,"Paris, Texas"
Anne Marie Biondo,"A rewarding story of distance, separation and ultimately, of renewed chances.","Paris, Texas"
Catherine Rambeau,"""Paris, Texas,"" despite its history of last-minute rewrites, is unsentimental adult entertainment.","Paris, Texas"
Derek Malcolm,"I've seldom seen such a potent combination of superior talents. Watch the first hour of the movie, and what you will see is an unparalleled summation of America as seen by wondering European eyes.","Paris, Texas"
Kathleen Carroll,"What separates ""Paris, Texas"" from most of today's movies is its gentle humanism.","Paris, Texas"
Sheila Benson,"A deeply affecting film about family, separation, loss and a man's last act of repentance.","Paris, Texas"
Jay Carr,The glum truth seems to be that Shepard and Wenders have let a great film get away from them.,"Paris, Texas"
Gene Siskel,"If this film doesn't successfully indict the destruction of the nuclear family, no film can.","Paris, Texas"
F.X. Feeney,"Paris, Texas is a landmark work in every sense: understated, powerful, sublime.","Paris, Texas"
Ray Pride,"The grief, the love, the loss; the images by the great, late Robby Mller. The kinetic, the peripatetic; the still, the stilled. The beating heart. The lonely man. The lonely land. I should just sit down and write a letter to Wim Wenders.","Paris, Texas"
Kirk Honeycutt,"Paris, Texas is the cinematic equivalent of a symphony. The film is composed in movements that chart the emotional lives of its characters -- of haunting images and anxious silences, of gestures, landscapes, weird juxtapositions and epiphanies.","Paris, Texas"
